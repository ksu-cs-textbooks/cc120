    <title>Regular Expressions :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/5-js/09-regexp/</link>
    <description>CONSOLE The JavaScript String prototype has some very powerful methods, such as String.prototype.includes() which recognizes when a string contains a substring - i.e.:&#xA;&#34;foobarwhen&#34;.includes(&#34;bar&#34;)would evaluate to true. But what if you needed a more general solution? Say, to see if the text matched a phone number pattern like XXX-XXX-XXXX? Thatâ€™s where Regular Expressions come in.&#xA;Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that define a pattern that can be searched for within a string.</description>
