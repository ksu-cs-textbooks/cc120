    <title>Basic Syntax :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/5-js/02-basic-syntax/</link>
    <description>CONSOLE Because Netscape was adopting Java at the same time they were developing what would become JavaScript, there was a push to make the syntax stay somewhat consistent between the two languages. As a result, JavaScript has much of the look and feel of an imperative language like C, C#, or Java.&#xA;However, this similarity can be deceptive, because how JavaScript operates can be quite different than those languages. This can lead to frustration for imperative programmers learning JavaScript.</description>
