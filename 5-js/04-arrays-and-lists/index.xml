    <title>Arrays - Lists by Another Name :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/5-js/04-arrays-and-lists/</link>
    <description>CONSOLE You might have noticed we used an array in discussing the for .. in loop, but didn’t talk about it in our data type discussion. This is because in JavaScript, an array is not a primitive data type. Rather, it’s a special kind of object.&#xA;This is one of those aspects of JavaScript that breaks strongly with imperative languages. Brandon Eich drew heavily from Scheme, which is a functional language that focuses heavily on list processing… and the JavaScript array actually has more to do with lists than it does arrays.</description>
