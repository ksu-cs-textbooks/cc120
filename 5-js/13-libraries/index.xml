    <title>JavaScript Libraries :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/5-js/13-libraries/</link>
    <description>Up to this point, weâ€™ve been focused on core JavaScript functionality. However, there are lots of additional JavaScript libraries you can use in your web development efforts. A library is a collection of source code that is intended to be used in other projects. Unlike core libraries, these are written by third parties, and often released under an open-source license which describes how they can legally be used in your projects.</description>
