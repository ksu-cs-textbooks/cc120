    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/5-js/03-functions/</link>

This leads to some of the common sources of confusion for programmers new to the language. Letâ€™s explore just what its functional roots mean.&#xA;JavaScript implements first-class functions, which means they can be assigned to a variable, passed as function arguments, returned from other functions, and even nested inside other functions.</description>
