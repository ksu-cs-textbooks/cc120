<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>As the World Wide Web was gaining popularity in the mid-nineties, browser manufacturers started experimenting with interpreting program scripts embedded within webpages.  By far the most successful of these was JavaScript, initially developed by Brandon Eich for Netscape.</p>

<p>Brandon Eich was hired to integrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" rel="external" target="_blank">Scheme programming language</a> into the Netscape browser.  But when Netscape cut a deal with Sun Microsystems to bring Java Applets to their browser, his mission was altered to create a more Java-like language.  He developed a prototype in only ten days, that blended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" rel="external" target="_blank">Java</a> syntax, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)" rel="external" target="_blank">Self</a> object-orientation approach, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" rel="external" target="_blank">Scheme</a> functionality.</p>
<p>Netscape eventually submitted JavaScript to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International" rel="external" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>, resulting in the ECMAScript standard, and opening the door for other browsers to adopt JavaScript.  Currently all major browsers support the full ECMAScript 5 standard, and large chunks of ECMAScript 6 and some parts of later versions as well. Moreover, <em>transpilation</em> can be utilized to make newer ECMAScript-compliant code run on older browser versions.</p>

<p>The ECMA standard is maintained by <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>, not the W3C.  However, its development process is very similar, involving stakeholders developing proposals for new and improved features.</p>
