<h1 id="strict-mode">Strict Mode</h1>

<p>JavaScript has been around a long time, and a lot of JavaScript code has been written by inexperienced programmers.  Browser manufacturers compensated for this by allowing lenient interpretation of JavaScript programs, and by ignoring many errors as they occurred.</p>
<p>While this made poorly-written scripts run, arguably they didn&rsquo;t run well.  In ECMA5, <em>strict mode</em> was introduced to solve the problems of lenient interpretation.</p>
<p>Strict mode <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" rel="external" target="_blank">according to the Mozilla Developer Network</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
<li>Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that&rsquo;s not strict mode.</li>
<li>Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can place the interpreter in strict mode by including this line at the start of your JavaScript file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s2">&#34;use strict&#34;</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In interpreters that don&rsquo;t support strict mode, this expression will be interpreted as a string and do nothing.</p>
