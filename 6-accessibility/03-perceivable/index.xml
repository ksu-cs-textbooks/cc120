    <title>Perceivable Content :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/6-accessibility/03-perceivable/</link>
    <description>What makes web content perceivable? Broadly speaking, the user must be able to see the content through one of their senses. We primarily think about this in terms of sight - the user should be able to see the content of the rendered page. But what we hear can also be a critical piece of perception.&#xA;Vision We often think of vision as the primary sense for engaging with web content - after all we read text and view pictures and videos.</description>
