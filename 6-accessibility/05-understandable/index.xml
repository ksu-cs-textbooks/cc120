You should strive to use proper grammar, correct spelling, and write to your audienceâ€™s expected reading level (or slightly below).&#xA;But this requirement also covers users understanding how to make use of interactive elements, especially graphical user interfaces. Making your content understandable benefits all users of your website, and is a staple to good web design.</description>
