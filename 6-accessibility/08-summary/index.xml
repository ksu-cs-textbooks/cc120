    <title>Summary :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/6-accessibility/08-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter, we discussed the need to build our websites to be accessible to all users. We also discussed many common disabilities that users may have, and strategies for addressing these in your web design. We also reviewed tools that we can take advantage of to build accessible websites.&#xA;We also learned that many of these techniques benefit all users. Strong color contrast can help both the vision impaired, and also help make your site visible on a screen outside on a bright day.</description>
