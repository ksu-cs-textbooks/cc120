    <title>The Vision of Sir Tim Berners Lee :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/1-www/02-the-technologies-of-the-web/</link>
    <description>When Tim-Berners Lee presented his original ideas for the World-Wide Web, it consisted of a protocol for requesting web documents - HTTP, and a markup language those documents could be written in - HTML. These initial technologies continue to be the foundation of the world-wide web, and have been enhanced by additional languages to style webpages - CSS - and modify them - JavaScript.&#xA;Each of these technologies has continued to evolve under the guidance of the W3C.</description>
