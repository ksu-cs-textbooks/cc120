    <title>Why Standards? :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>

    <description>The Web Standards the W3C and ECMA International maintain are a critical piece of the web infrastructure. Having a standard for how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be interpreted by a web browser means that every browser can display the same webpage in the same way - allowing you the choice of your favorite browser without worrying your web browsing experience would be impacted.&#xA;This was not always the case; during the early days of the world-wide-web in a period known as the Browser Wars the browsers Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer both added features to their browsers not defined in the standards, and web developers had to decide which browser to build against.</description>
