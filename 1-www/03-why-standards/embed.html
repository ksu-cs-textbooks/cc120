<p>The Web Standards the W3C and ECMA International maintain are a critical piece of the web infrastructure. Having a standard for how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be interpreted by a web browser means that every browser can display the same webpage in the same way - allowing you the choice of your favorite browser without worrying your web browsing experience would be impacted.</p>
<p>This was not always the case; during the early days of the world-wide-web in a period known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" rel="external" target="_blank">Browser Wars</a> the browsers Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer both added features to their browsers <em>not</em> defined in the standards, and web developers had to decide which browser to build against.</p>
<p>Even after that point, Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer did not adopt the full standards, forcing web developers to build their web pages to display in a standards-compliant browser (like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari), then modify their design to work within Internet Explorer. Thankfully, even Microsoft grew frustrated with maintaining the non-compliant Internet Explorer, and replaced it with Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The web standards also provide a mechanism for adding new features. The approach involves all stakeholders in the process, and allows browser manufacturers to add &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; features so that new ideas can be tried out before being adopted. In fact, browser manufacturers often adopt different approaches to a potential feature, allowing for a comparison before a final standard is adopted.</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>All standards maintained by the W3C are <em>voluntary</em> - there is no mechanism to force a browser manufacturer to support a particular feature. Some features may take a long time to be adopted by all browsers, or may never be adopted.  The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="external" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> offer a table with each feature identifying which version (if any) of the major web browsers have adopted the feature.</p>
