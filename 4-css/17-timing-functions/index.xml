    <title>CSS Timing Functions :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/4-css/17-timing-functions/</link>
    <description>The transition property (and the animations weâ€™ll look at shortly) both make use of timing functions - functions that define how the values of a CSS property change over time as we transition from one state to the next.&#xA;The simplest (and default) transition function is linear, which means the value smoothly transitions from its starting value to its ending value. It is specified as linear.&#xA;While linear is easy to reason about and represent mathematically, transitions often look more realistic if the start or end more slowly, speeding up in the middle.</description>
