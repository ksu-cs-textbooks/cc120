    <title>CSS Transformations :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/4-css/15-css-transformations/</link>
    <description>With powerful graphics cards becoming commonplace, the W3C standards expanded the CSS rules to take advantage of their abilities. Specifically, the CSS transform property allows us to apply a transformation (scaling, rotating, translating, stretching, skewing, or any combination) to elements on a page. These are performed using a mathematical operation based on the use of matrices. Graphics cards are optimized to perform these matrix operations in parallel, allowing them to quickly transform graphical objects in 3-dimensional space.</description>
