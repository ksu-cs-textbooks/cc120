<p>While you can write custom CSS to accomplish nearly any look you want for your webpages, many developers prefer to use a pre-written CSS library that provides rules covering many common user interface needs.  For example, CSS-based menus are very challenging to write well, but a well-designed library makes the task very approachable.  CSS libraries also provide a consistent UI look and feel across websites, which helps people browsing your website quickly identify how to move around.</p>
<p>One of the most popular CSS frameworks is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which is used by thousands of websites.  Other popular CSS libraries include <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>, <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Semantic</a>, and <a href="https://animate.style/" rel="external" target="_blank">Animate</a> which as the name suggests provides animation components.</p>
