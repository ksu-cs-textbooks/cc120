    <title>CSS Libraries :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/4-css/19-libraries/</link>
    <description>While you can write custom CSS to accomplish nearly any look you want for your webpages, many developers prefer to use a pre-written CSS library that provides rules covering many common user interface needs. For example, CSS-based menus are very challenging to write well, but a well-designed library makes the task very approachable. CSS libraries also provide a consistent UI look and feel across websites, which helps people browsing your website quickly identify how to move around.</description>
