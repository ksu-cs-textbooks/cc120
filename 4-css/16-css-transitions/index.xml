    <title>CSS Transitions :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/4-css/16-css-transitions/</link>
    <description>While most CSS rules are applied as the page is loaded, some are applied at a future point. One example is pseudo-classes that apply in limited circumstances - like :hover which applies only when the mouse is over an element, or :valid and :invalid which are applied to input elements based on their validation status. Another common instance is when elements are added to the page using JavaScript, as discussed in Chapter 5 - JavaScript.</description>
