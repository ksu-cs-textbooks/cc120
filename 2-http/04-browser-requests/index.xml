    <title>Browser Requests :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/2-http/04-browser-requests/</link>
    <description>Now that you are familiar with the network panel, let’s explore the primary kind of request you’re already used to making - requests originating from a browser. Every time you use a browser to browse the Internet, you are creating a series of HTTP (or HTTPS) requests that travel across the networks between you and a web server, which responds to your requests.&#xA;When you type in an address in your browser (or click a hyperlink), this initiates a HTTP request against the server located at that address.</description>
