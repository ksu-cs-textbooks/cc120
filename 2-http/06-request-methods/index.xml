    <title>Request Methods :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/2-http/06-request-methods/</link>
    <description>When a web client like a browser makes a request, it must specify the request method, indicating what kind of request this is (sometimes we refer to the method as a HTTP Verb).&#xA;The two most common are GET and POST requests, as these are typically the only kinds supported by browsers. Other request methods include PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, which are typically used by other kinds of web clients. Weâ€™ll focus on just GET and POST requests here.</description>
