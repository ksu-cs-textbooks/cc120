    <title>Raster Graphic Files :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/02-raster-graphic-files/</link>
    <description>Unsurprisingly, graphic files that store their data in a raster format borrow heavily from the representations discussed previously. Typically, a graphic file consists of two parts, a head and a body. This is very much like how the &lt;head&gt; of a HTML file provides metadata about the page and the &lt;body&gt; contains the actual page contents. For a raster graphic file, the head of the file contains metadata describing the image itself - the color format, along with the width and height of the image.</description>
