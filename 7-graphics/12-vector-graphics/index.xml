    <title>Vector Graphics :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/12-vector-graphics/</link>
    <description>Up to this point, weâ€™ve been discussing raster graphics, which are represented by a grid of pixels. In contrast, vector graphics are stored as a series of instructions to re-create the graphic. For most vector approaches, these instructions look similar to those we issued to our JavaScript rendering context when working with the &lt;canvas&gt; element - including the idea of paths, stroke, and fill.&#xA;The vector approach has its own benefits and drawbacks when compared to raster graphics.</description>
