<p>Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve been discussing raster graphics, which are represented by a grid of pixels.  In contrast, <em>vector</em> graphics are stored as <em>a series of instructions</em> to re-create the graphic. For most vector approaches, these instructions look similar to those we issued to our JavaScript rendering context when working with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element - including the idea of paths, stroke, and fill.</p>
<p>The vector approach has its own benefits and drawbacks when compared to raster graphics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Computation</strong> Before a vector graphic can be displayed, it has to be rendered into a raster form, much like we had to instruct our context to render into a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. This requires some computation, whereas rendering a raster graphic simply requires copying its bits from one buffer to another (assuming we aren&rsquo;t scaling it).</li>
<li><strong>Better Scaling</strong> Perhaps the biggest benefit is that the problems we see when scaling a raster graphic don&rsquo;t happen with vector graphics.  If we want to make the graphic ten times larger, then when we convert it into a raster, we can scale up the drawing instructions to ten times the normal size.</li>
<li><strong>Less Photorealistic</strong> Vector graphics are best suited for images with well-defined shapes with little shading - things like clipart and cartoon characters. To approach photorealism requires a lot of small shapes drawn in different colors, and will require both more memory and computation.  In contrast, a raster graphic is excellent at photorealism. Digital cameras actually create a raster graphic from a grid of color sensors behind the lens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the scaling benefits, vector graphics are used for commonly used for fonts, icons, and logos, and other images that may be presented at vastly different scales.</p>
