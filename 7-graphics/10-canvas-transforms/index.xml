    <title>Transforms and State :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/10-canvas-transforms/</link>
    <description>Much like we can use CSS to apply transformations to HTML elements, we can use transforms to change how we draw into a canvas. The rendering context has a transformation matrix much like those we discussed in the CSS chapter, and it applies this transform to any point it is tasked with drawing.&#xA;We can replace the current transformation matrix with the setTransform() function, or multiply it by a new transformation (effectively combining the current transformation with the new one) by calling transform().</description>
