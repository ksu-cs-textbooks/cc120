    <title>The Pen Metaphor :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/05-the-pen-metaphor/</link>
    <description>Most 2D graphics libraries adopt a “pen” metaphor to model how they interact with the graphics they draw. Think of an imaginary pen that you use to draw on the screen. When you put the pen down and move it across the screen you draw a line - the stroke. When you lift the pen, you no longer make a mark. The movements of the pen across the canvas also define a path.</description>
