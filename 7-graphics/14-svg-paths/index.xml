    <title>SVG Paths :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/14-svg-paths/</link>
    <description>SVGs use the same pen metaphor we saw with the &lt;canvas&gt; and one of the most basic approaches to drawing in an SVG is the &lt;path&gt; element. Each &lt;path&gt; should contain a d attribute, which holds the commands used to draw the path. These are very similar to the commands we used with the &lt;canvas&gt; and the CanvasRenderingContext2D we used earlier, but instead of being written as a function call, they are written as a capital letter (indicating what command to carry out) followed by numbers specifying the action.</description>
