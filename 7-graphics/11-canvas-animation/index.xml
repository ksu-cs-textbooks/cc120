    <title>Animation :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/7-graphics/11-canvas-animation/</link>
    <description>The canvas element provides a powerful tool for creating animations by allowing us to erase and re-draw its contents over and over. Ideally, we only want to redraw the canvas contents only as quickly as the screen is updated (typically every 1/30th or 1/60th of a second). The window.requestAnimationFrame(callback) provides an approach for doing this - it triggers the supplied callback every time the monitor refreshes.&#xA;Inside that callback, we want to erase the canvas and then draw the updated scene.</description>
