    <title>Introduction :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>

    <description>In computer graphics, we have two primary approaches to representing graphical information, raster and vector representations.&#xA;Raster graphics take their name from the scan pattern of a cathode-ray tube, such as was used in older television sets and computer monitors. These, as well as modern monitors, rely on a regular grid of pixels composed of three colors of light (red, green, and blue) that are mixed at different intensities to create all colors of the visible spectrum.</description>
