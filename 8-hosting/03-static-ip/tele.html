<h1 id="static-ip-addresses">Static IP Addresses</h1>

<p>You may remember from our discussion of <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/2-http/02-uris-and-urls/" rel="external" target="_blank">URIs and URLs in Chapter 2</a> that a HTTP request must be made against a <em>host</em>.  This host is specified either by a fully-qualified domain name, or by an Internet Protocol (IP) address. But what exactly is an IP address?</p>
<p>An IP address is an address of a specific computer on the internet. Without such an address, we would not be able to send HTTP requests or responses to a computer, because we would have no idea where to send it. This is much like a mailing addresses in the real world - you need to know where to send a letter for the post office to deliver it.</p>
<p>Now we get to the interesting part - unlike mailing addresses, there are a limited number of IP addresses because we represent them with a specific number of bits (32 bits for IPV4 addresses, and 128 for the new IPV6 addresses).</p>

<p>Because of this limit, internet providers don&rsquo;t assign every customer a unique IP address. Instead, they use a <em>pool</em> of addresses. When your computer connects to the internet, they draw a currently unused IP address from the pool and assign it to your computer. This is your computer&rsquo;s address until you disconnect.  The next time you connect, you may get a different IP address.  It&rsquo;s kind of like parking in a parking garage - you probably won&rsquo;t get the same space every time.</p>
<p>This makes hosting a website from a consumer internet account very difficult, because every time you get a new IP address, you&rsquo;d need to update everyone about where to find your web server. Also, many consumer ISP agreements actually forbid you from hosting a website on your account - so read your agreements carefully.</p>
<p>In contrast, when you sign up with an ISP as a web host (often a feature of business plans), your ISP provides one or more IP address that your computer(s) will <em>always</em> be assigned. We call these <em>static IP addresses</em> because they don&rsquo;t change. This means that even if your computer is disconnected from the internet temporarily, when you reconnect, you will still have the same IP address. These accounts also typically provide more <em>upstream</em> data (the data your computer sends out across the internet), which is important as a web server will send far more data upstream than a consumer browsing the internet will.</p>
<p>Thus, if you plan on hosting your own website, you want a static IP address provided by a hosting plan with your ISP.</p>
