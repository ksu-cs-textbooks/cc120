    <title>Static IP Addresses :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/8-hosting/03-static-ip/</link>
    <description>You may remember from our discussion of URIs and URLs in Chapter 2 that a HTTP request must be made against a host. This host is specified either by a fully-qualified domain name, or by an Internet Protocol (IP) address. But what exactly is an IP address?&#xA;An IP address is an address of a specific computer on the internet. Without such an address, we would not be able to send HTTP requests or responses to a computer, because we would have no idea where to send it.</description>
