    <title>Server Hardware :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/8-hosting/02-server-hardware/</link>
    <description>The server hardware is really nothing more than a computer - essentially the same as your desktop or laptop. It has a CPU, RAM, hard drives, and a network card, just like your PC - often they are exactly the same hardware as you might find in a PC. But in many cases, they may be designed for sustained repeated and heavy use - basically a more robust (and expensive) version of consumer hardware.</description>
