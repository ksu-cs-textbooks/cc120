    <title>GitHub Pages :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/8-hosting/08-github-pages/</link>
    <description>There are endless number of website hosting options out there with varying ranges of prices and effort to maintain. For now, we are going to go with a middle ground option with GitHub Pages. GitHub pages offers an easy way of hosting static websites (static websites have no back-end server logic, like databases, users, etc.). You can host one public facing website for free with a basic account and more if you have a pro account.</description>
