    <description>Earlier, when we looked at HTTP in Chapter 2, we discussed how HTTP connects the client (typically a web browser) to a server, a specialized program running on a computer connected to the internet that serves web pages (and other files) in response to a HTTP request. This server is what makes your webpages available on the World Wide Web.&#xA;Somewhat confusingly, web developers and IT professionals commonly refer to both the program serving HTTP requests and the hardware it runs on as a server.</description>
