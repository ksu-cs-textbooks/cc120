<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Earlier, when we <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/2-http/" rel="external" target="_blank">looked at HTTP in Chapter 2</a>, we discussed how HTTP connects the client (typically a web browser) to a <em>server</em>, a specialized program running on a computer connected to the internet that serves web pages (and other files) in response to a HTTP request. This server is what makes your webpages available on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, web developers and IT professionals commonly refer to <em>both</em> the program serving HTTP requests <em>and</em> the hardware it runs on as a <em>server</em>. To help avoid this confusion in this chapter, we&rsquo;ll refer to the computer running the server as the <em>server hardware</em> and the software program serving HTTP requests as the <em>server program</em>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at exactly what a server (both hardware and program) is, and how it is made accessible on the web. Then we&rsquo;ll examine some of the most widely used of the server programs: Apache, Nginx, and IIS. We&rsquo;ll also discuss setting up domain names and security certificates - all the steps necessary for hosting your own websites.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>We will look at setting up these servers to serve <em>static</em> content - the kinds of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files you&rsquo;ve been writing in this class. However, it is important to understand that a web server can also <em>dynamically create</em> files to send as a response - as you see every time you use a search engine or an online store. In these cases, the HTML they send is <em>created by the server</em> in response to the requests made by you, the user. This kind of dynamic web content creation is the subject of the follow-on courses, <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc515" rel="external" target="_blank">CC 515 - Full Stack Web Development</a> and <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526" rel="external" target="_blank">CIS 526 - Web Application Development</a>.</p>
