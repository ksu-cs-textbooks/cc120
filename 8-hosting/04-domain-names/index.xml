    <title>Domain Names :: K-State CC 120 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc120/8-hosting/04-domain-names/</link>
    <description>A domain name is a human-readable name that can be used instead of an IP address when making HTTP requests. While not actually required for hosting a website, a domain name is definitely something you’ll want to have. After all, you don’t want people to have to memorize an IP address to reach your website.&#xA;Domain names are essentially leased (rented) from a domain registrar - a company that sells domain names.</description>
