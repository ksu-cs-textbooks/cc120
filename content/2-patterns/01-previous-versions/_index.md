This is a pattern for managing previous versions of a page. It uses a [branch bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) combined with a hidden folder and the [children](https://learn.netlify.app/en/shortcodes/children/) shortcode. 

This page would be the current version of the page.
