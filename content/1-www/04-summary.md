This textbook will guide you through the three core client-side web technologies (HTML, CSS, & JS), as well as discuss the role HTTP plays in retrieving resources for a web client (like a browser) from the web.  It is organized into chapters focused on each of those technologies in turn:

1. [The World-Wide-Web]({{% ref 1-www %}})
2. [Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol]({{% ref 2-http %}})
3. [Hyper-Text Markup Language]({{% ref 3-html %}})
4. [Cascading Style Sheets]({{% ref 4-css %}})
5. [JavaScript]({{% ref 5-js %}})

Once you understand client-side web technologies, you may want to turn your attention to the server side. The follow up textbook to this one covers those topics: [Full Stack Web Development](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520)
