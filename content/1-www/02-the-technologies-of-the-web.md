When Tim-Berners Lee presented his original ideas for the World-Wide Web, it consisted of a protocol for requesting web documents - __HTTP__, and a markup language those documents could be written in - __HTML__. These initial technologies continue to be the foundation of the world-wide web, and have been enhanced by technologies to style webpages - __CSS__ - and modify them - __JavaScript__.

Each of these technologies has continued to evolve under the guidance of the W3C.  As of this writing, HTTP is in its 2nd version, HTML is in its 5th, CSS is in its 4th, and JavaScript is in its 7th.  Each of these technologies is explored in its own chapter of the book, which can be accessed from the table of contents.

The full standards for each can be found in the __World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)__ organization's website [www.w3c.org](www.w3c.org), and great developer support is offered on each through the __Mozilla Developer Network__ [developer.mozilla.org](developer.mozilla.org).  While originally the official documentation for Mozilla's Firefox browser, Microsoft partnered with MDN as the official documentation source for their Edge browser.  Additionally, MDN documents how the Safari, Opera, and IE browsers support the web standards, making it a great reference for a web developer.
