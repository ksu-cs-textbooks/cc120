This site supports a "dark mode" CSS feature. It is implemented through buttons on the upper toolbar:

* <i class="fas fa-moon"></i> - Enable Dark Mode
* <i class="fas fa-sun"></i> - Disable Dark Mode

The switch requires Javascript. Code for this is included in the `themer.js` and `theme-purple.css` files.
