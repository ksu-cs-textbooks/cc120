Now that we've discussed the request-response pattern and address resolution, let's turn our attention to how requests are processed in the browser.  The following tutorial from Google describes the network panel in Chrome:

Also, open the <a href="https://devtools.glitch.me/network/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Get Started Demo</a> page it references. (This example is outdated. Feel free to try any other website to test the features )

Or, if you prefer you can work through the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/#open" target="_blank">written version of the tutorial</a>

Similar developer tools exist in other browsers:
* [Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/)
* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac)
* [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/network/)
