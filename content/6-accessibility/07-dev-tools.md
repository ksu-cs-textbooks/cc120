We've also talked about Screen Readers and Magnifiers, which are typically integrated into your operating system. You can use these to experience your web page the same way a disabled user might.

Similarly, a colorblindness simulator can alter the colors in your screen to simulate what a colorblind person might see.  A good example is [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/), a free and open-source tool that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
