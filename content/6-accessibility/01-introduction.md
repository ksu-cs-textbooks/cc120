An important consideration when designing a website is how people will work with it. We want to design our websites in a way that they are useable by everyone in our anticipated audience - bet that everyone in the world, university students, employees at our company, or customers of our business. But there is a segment of each of these audiences that is often overlooked - those with disabilities.  

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. <br/> - Sir Tim Berners-Lee

Globally, about 15% of the world's population experiences some form of disability. The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with DIsabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html) recognizes access to the Web, and the information it makes available, as **a basic human right**. Many countries have followed suit, even codifying accessibility requirements into laws like the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://beta.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/).

In short, it is vital when you author a website, you consider how those with disabilities will interact with it.  Moreover, building your website to be accessible will also make your website more usable for _all_ users.
