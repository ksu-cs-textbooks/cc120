This course does not have a required print textbook.  The resources presented in the modules are also organized into an online textbook that can be accessed here: [{{< param textbookURL >}}]({{< param textbookURL >}}).  You may find this a useful reference if you prefer a traditional textbook layout.  Additionally, since the textbook exists outside of Canvas' access control, you can continue to utilize it after the course ends.

### O'Riley for Higher Education

If you are looking for additional resources to support your learning, a great resource that is available to Kansas State University students is the [O'Riley For Higher Education](https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university) digital library offered through the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of thousands of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.  As of this writing, a search for HTML returns 29,226 results, CSS returns 9106 results, and JavaScript returns 19,015 results.  In particular, I would recommend these books:

* ["Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/secrets-of-the/9781617292859/) by John Resig and Bear Bibeault.

There are likewise materials for other computer science topics you may have an interest in - it is a great resource for all your CS coursework.  It costs you nothing (technically, your access was paid for by your tuition and fees), so you might as well make use of it!
