### Course Overview

The Internet, web browsers, and web-page-development technology: web-page design and implementation with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and CSS. Integration of program script into web pages. Introduction to graphics design, animation, and server utilization.

### Required Texts
This course does not have a required print textbook.  The resources presented in the modules are also organized into an online textbook that can be accessed here: [{{< ref "/" >}}]({{< ref "/" >}}).  You may find this a useful reference if you prefer a traditional textbook layout.  Additionally, since the textbook exists outside of Canvas' access control, you can continue to utilize it after the course ends.

{{% notice warning %}}
Please note that the materials presented in Canvas have additional graded assignments and exercises worked into the reading order that do not appear in the online edition of the textbook.  You are responsible for completing these!

#### CS Departmental Textbook Server
The CC 120 course textbook is only one of several textbooks authored by your instructors and made available on the departmental server.  For example, your CC 120 textbook is also available there for you to go back and review.  You can access any of these textbooks at the site <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu" target="_blank">https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu</a>

#### O'Riley for Higher Education

If you are looking for additional resources to support your learning, a great resource that is available to Kansas State University students is the [O'Riley For Higher Education](https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university) digital library offered through the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of thousands of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.  As of this writing, a search for HTML returns 29,226 results, CSS returns 9106 results, and JavaScript returns 19,015 results.  In particular, I would recommend these books:

* ["Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/secrets-of-the/9781617292859/) by John Resig and Bear Bibeault.

There are likewise materials for other computer science topics you may have an interest in - it is a great resource for all your CS coursework.  It costs you nothing (technically, your access was paid for by your tuition and fees), so you might as well make use of it!

#### MDN Web Docs

The [MDN Web Dos](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a collection of documentation and developer resources. It documents the web standards and discusses exactly how different browsers have implemented them.  It is the official documentation source for the Mozilla browser AND for Google, Microsoft, and Samsung's browsers.

### Course Description

In this course students gain experience writing web pages using the three core client-side technologies of the world-wide web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Additionally, we examine how the world-wide-web works, especially HTTP requests and responses.  The goal is to help you develop the fundamental skills to develop interesting, effective, accessible, and reliable web pages using current industry standards.  

### Major Course Topics

* The World-Wide-Web
* Web Pages
* Browsers and web clients
* Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* CSS Animations
* JavaScript (JS)
* The Document Object Model (DOM)
* Web Accessability
* Web Forms
* Web Requests
* Web Graphics
* Web Hosting
* Common Web Libraries

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:
* Create valid HTML webpages using separation of concerns with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Use CSS rules to create engaging, effective, accessible, and responsive web page designs.
* Utilize HTML forms to submit data to a web API
* Use JavaScript to dynamically modify the structure and appearance of a webpage.
* Employ AJAX/Fetch requests to interact with Web APIs.
* Think critically about web page design and apply solid web page design principles to their work.

###  Course Structure

These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.

A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is **"the person doing the work is the person doing the learning."** What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don't serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.

### The Work
{{% notice warning%}}
There is no shortcut to becoming a web developer. Only by **doing the work** will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer. Posting (even if you don’t get a response) course content on Stack Overflow, Chegg, or other similar websites is expressly forbidden and will result in an XF. This also includes viewing solutions to course content that has not been provided to you through canvas by your instructor or TA. The use of AI assisted tools to write your assignments is also explicitly forbidden (ChatGPT, GitHub Code Pilot, etc.). You may use these tools as help in the learning process, but work that you submit for a grade must be 100% done by you and only you.

    *If you are struggling in the course or you have doubts on something, please ask!  Your instructors and TAs are here to help!*

**Quizzes** Many modules will include quizzes which cover the theory, concepts, and vocabulary used in web development. This is all information you should be familiar with as a future web developer.  Most quizzes will allow multiple retakes.

**Tutorials & Examples:** Each module will include many tutorial assignments and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in project assignments, so it is important that you take the time to learn from these.

**Project Assignments:** Throughout the semester you will be building a number of web pages, including a personal website. Note that all web pages you build for this course should be _valid_ - your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript _must_ conform to the standards. Additionally, you will be expected to address accessibility and security in your projects once we've covered these topics.

### Grading

In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:

* 30% - Quizzes
* 30% - Tutorials & Exercises
* 40% - Projects

Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the **Extra Credit - Bug Bounty** & **Extra Credit - Helping Hands** assignments for details.

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:

* 90% - 100% &rarr; A
* 80% - 89.99% &rarr; B
* 70% - 79.99% &rarr; C
* 60% - 69.99% &rarr; D
* 00% - 59.99% &rarr; F

### Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy

As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.

Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones. 

For the website milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.

Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.

That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor's receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment's due date has now passed. 

### Collaboration Policy

In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance. 

### Late Work

{{% notice warning %}}
Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won't apply to you!
{{% /notice %}}

Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. **Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment's grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late (pro-rated by hour). This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.** For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.

However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.

Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.

If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.

### Recommended Texts & Supplies

To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.

Students may choose to do some development work on their own computer. The recommended software is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with access to a system running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). For Windows systems, Ubuntu can be installed via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). For Mac systems, Ubuntu can be installed in a virtual machine through [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
