While you can write custom CSS to accomplish nearly any look you want for your webpages, many developers prefer to use a pre-written CSS library that provides rules covering many common user interface needs.  For example, CSS-based menus are very challenging to write well, but a well-designed library makes the task very approachable.  CSS libraries also provide a consistent UI look and feel across websites, which helps people browsing your website quickly identify how to move around.

One of the most popular CSS frameworks is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which is used by thousands of websites.  Other popular CSS libraries include [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Semantic](https://semantic-ui.com/), and [Animate](https://animate.style/) which as the name suggests provides animation components.
