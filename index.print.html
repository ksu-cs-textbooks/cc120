<p>This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.</p>
<p>When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you&rsquo;ll primarily interact with the course. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.</p>
<p>When you first arrive at the Modules section, you&rsquo;ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren&rsquo;t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I&rsquo;ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.</p>
<p>As you look at each module, you&rsquo;ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says &ldquo;Complete All Items.&rdquo; Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.</p>
<p>Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you&rsquo;ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say <em>view</em>, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say <em>contribute</em>, <em>submit</em>, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You&rsquo;ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.</p>
<p>When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I&rsquo;ll click through a couple of items here.</p>
<p>At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you&rsquo;ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>Continuing down the menu to the left, you&rsquo;ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.</p>
<p>Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the <em>Guide</em> for that module. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface.</p>

<p>As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance. This video reviews the various types of help available to you in this course.</p>
<p>First and foremost, anytime you have a questions or need assistance in the Computational Core program, please send an email to the appropriate help group for this course. In this case, it would be cc120-help, or <a href="mailto:cc120-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com">cc120-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>
. That email goes to the instructors and GTAs, and is your best chance to get a quick response. We&rsquo;ll respond to your email within one business day.</p>
<p>Beyond email, there are a few resources you should be aware of. First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, your first source of help is the K-State IT Helpdesk. They can easily be reached via email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ksu.edu">helpdesk@ksu.edu</a>
. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video. As a last resort, you may also want to email the help group, but in most cases we may simply redirect you to the K-State helpdesk for assistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have any issues using the Codio platform, you are welcome to refer to their online documentation. Their support staff offers a quick and easy chat interface where you can ask questions and get feedback within a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there.</p>
<p>If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to post your question as an email to the help group. As discussed earlier, the instructors and GTAs will do their best to help you as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t start building that skill now.</p>
<p>Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. Since this is an online course, you&rsquo;ll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please email me directly as soon as possible and let me know about your concern, if it is appropriate for me to be involved. If not, or if you&rsquo;d rather talk with someone other than me about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your academic advisor, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/report/" target="_blank">https://www.k-state.edu/report/</a>
. That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.</p>
<p>Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, email the help group. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.</p>
<p>So, in summary, reviewing the existing course content should always be your first stop when you have a question or run into a problem, since most issues can be solved there. If you are still stuck, email cc410-help to ask for assistance, and we&rsquo;ll get back to you within a business day. For issues with Canvas or Codio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please email cc410-help or the instructors directly for assistance.</p>
<p>Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don&rsquo;t be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p>
<p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li>
<li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p>
<p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p>
<p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.</p>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong>&ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo;</strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don&rsquo;t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a web developer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong> Many modules will include quizzes which cover the theory, concepts, and vocabulary used in web development. This is all information you should be familiar with as a future web developer.  Most quizzes will allow multiple retakes.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials &amp; Examples:</strong> Each module will include many tutorial assignments and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in project assignments, so it is important that you take the time to learn from these.</p>
<p><strong>Project Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building a number of web pages, including a personal website. Note that all web pages you build for this course should be <em>valid</em> - your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <em>must</em> conform to the standards. Additionally, you will be expected to address accessibility and security in your projects once we&rsquo;ve covered these topics.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% - Quizzes</li>
<li>30% - Tutorials &amp; Exercises</li>
<li>40% - Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the <strong>Extra Credit - Bug Bounty</strong> &amp; <strong>Extra Credit - Helping Hands</strong> assignments for details.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-regrading-and-early-grading-policy">Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy</h3>
<p>As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.</p>
<p>Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones.</p>
<p>For the website milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.</p>
<p>Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.</p>
<p>That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor&rsquo;s receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment&rsquo;s due date has now passed.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment&rsquo;s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</strong> For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank">K-State Grading Policy</a>
 for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>
, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<p>Students may choose to do some development work on their own computer. The recommended software is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>

While working for CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), Tim Burners-Lee proposed bringing the ideas of hyper-text documents together with emerging Internet technologies like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Domain Name System (DNS) to create the World-Wide Web.  He defined the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the first web server, and the first web browser, in 1990 demonstrating the feasibility of the idea. Since that time, the web has grown to contain around <em>1.7 billion</em> webpages<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect — to help people work together — and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into families, associations, and companies. We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner.
<br>-Sir Tim Berners-Lee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim Burners-Lee went on to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to continue developing and maintaining web standards.  He has been the recipient of numerous prestigious international awards and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2004 for his contributions to society.</p>

<h1 id="the-vision-of-sir-tim-berners-lee">The Vision of Sir Tim Berners Lee</h1>

<p>When Tim-Berners Lee presented his original ideas for the World-Wide Web, it consisted of a protocol for requesting web documents - <strong>HTTP</strong>, and a markup language those documents could be written in - <strong>HTML</strong>. These initial technologies continue to be the foundation of the world-wide web, and have been enhanced by additional languages to style webpages - <strong>CSS</strong> - and modify them - <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>Each of these technologies has continued to evolve under the guidance of the W3C.  As of this writing, HTTP is in its 2nd version, HTML is in its 5th, CSS is in its 4th, and JavaScript is in its 7th.  Each of these technologies is explored in its own chapter of the book.</p>
<p>The full standards for each can be found in the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong> organization&rsquo;s website <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/1-www/02-the-technologies-of-the-web/www.w3c.org">www.w3c.org</a>
, with the exception of JavaScript, which uses the ECMAScript standard maintained by <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>
.</p>
<p>Great developer support is offered on each through the <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong> <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/1-www/02-the-technologies-of-the-web/developer.mozilla.org">developer.mozilla.org</a>
.  While originally the official documentation for Mozilla&rsquo;s Firefox browser, Microsoft partnered with MDN as the official documentation source for their Edge browser.  Additionally, MDN documents how the Safari, Opera, and IE browsers support the web standards, making it a great reference for a web developer.</p>

<h1 id="why-standards">Why Standards?</h1>

<p>The Web Standards the W3C and ECMA International maintain are a critical piece of the web infrastructure. Having a standard for how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be interpreted by a web browser means that every browser can display the same webpage in the same way - allowing you the choice of your favorite browser without worrying your web browsing experience would be impacted.</p>
<p>This was not always the case; during the early days of the world-wide-web in a period known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank">Browser Wars</a>
 the browsers Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer both added features to their browsers <em>not</em> defined in the standards, and web developers had to decide which browser to build against.</p>
<p>Even after that point, Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer did not adopt the full standards, forcing web developers to build their web pages to display in a standards-compliant browser (like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari), then modify their design to work within Internet Explorer. Thankfully, even Microsoft grew frustrated with maintaining the non-compliant Internet Explorer, and replaced it with Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The web standards also provide a mechanism for adding new features. The approach involves all stakeholders in the process, and allows browser manufacturers to add &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; features so that new ideas can be tried out before being adopted. In fact, browser manufacturers often adopt different approaches to a potential feature, allowing for a comparison before a final standard is adopted.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>At the heart of the world wide web is the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  This is a protocol defining how HTTP servers (which host web pages) interact with HTTP clients (which display web pages).</p>
<p>It starts with a request initiated from the web browser or other client.  This request is sent over the Internet using the TCP protocol to a web server.  Once the web server receives the request, it must decide the appropriate response - ideally sending the requested resource back to the browser to be displayed.  The following diagram displays this typical request-response pattern.</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<p>This HTTP request-response pattern is at the core of how all web applications communicate.  Even those that use websockets begin with an HTTP request.</p>

<h1 id="uris-and-urls">URIs and URLs</h1>

<p>Before a web request can be made, the browser needs to know where the resource requested can be found.  This is the role that a Universal Resource Locator (a URL) plays.  A URL is a specific kind of Universal Resource Indicator (URI) that specifies how a specific resource can be retrieved.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p><strong>URLs and URIs</strong>
The terms URL and URI are often used interchangeably in practice.  However, a URL is a specific subset of URIs that indicate <em>how to retrieve a resource over a network</em>; while a URI identifies a unique resource, it does not necessarily indicate how to retrieve it.  For example, a book&rsquo;s ISBN can be represented as a URI in the form <em>urn:isbn:0130224189</em>.  But this URI cannot be put into a browser&rsquo;s Location to retrieve the associated book.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A URI consists of several parts, according to the definition (elements in brackets are optional):</p>
<p><code>URI = scheme:[//[userinfo@]host[:port]]path[?query][#fragment]</code></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break this down into individual parts:</p>
<p><strong>scheme:</strong> The scheme refers to the resource is identified and (potentially) accessed.  For web development, the primary schemes we deal with are <em>http</em> (hyper-text transfer protocol), <em>https</em> (secure hyper-text transfer protocol), and <em>file</em> (indicating a file opened from the local computer).</p>
<p><strong>userinfo:</strong> The userinfo is used to identify a specific user.  It consists of a username optionally followed by a colon (<code>:</code>) and password.  We will discuss its use in the section on HTTP authentication, but note that this approach is rarely used today, and carries potential security risks.</p>
<p><strong>host:</strong> The host consists of either a fully quantified domain name (i.e. google.com, cs.ksu.edu, or gdc.ksu.edu) or an ip address (i.e. <code>172.217.1.142</code> or <code>[2607:f8b0:4004:803::200e]</code>).  IPv4 addresses <em>must</em> be separated by periods, and IPv6 addresses must be closed in brackets.  Additionally, web developers will often use the loopback host, <code>localhost</code>, which refers to the local machine rather than a location on the network.</p>
<p><strong>port:</strong> The port refers to the port number on the host machine.  If it is not specified (which is typical), the default port for the scheme is assumed: port 80 for HTTP, and port 443 for HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong>path:</strong> The path refers to the path to the desired resource on the server.  It consists of segments separated by forward slashes (<code>/</code>).</p>
<p><strong>query:</strong> The query consists of optional collection of key-value pairs (expressed as key:value), separated by ampersands (<code>&amp;</code>), and proceeded by a question mark (<code>?</code>).  The query string is used to supply modifiers to the requested resource (for example, applying a filter or searching for a term).</p>
<p><strong>fragment:</strong> The fragment is an optional string proceeded by a hashtag (<code>#</code>).  It identifies a portion of the resource to retrieve.  It is most often used to auto-scroll to a section of an HTML document, and also for navigation in some single-page web applications.</p>
<p>Thus, the URL <code>https://google.com</code> indicates we want to use the secure HTTP scheme to access the server at google.com using its port 443.  This should retrieve Google&rsquo;s main page.</p>
<p>Similarly, the url <code>https://google.com/search?q=HTML</code> will open a Google search result page for the term HTML (Google uses the key <code>q</code> to identify search terms).</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the request-response pattern and address resolution, let&rsquo;s turn our attention to how requests are processed in the browser.  The following tutorial from Google describes the network panel in Chrome:</p>

<h1 id="browser-requests">Browser Requests</h1>

<p>Now that you are familiar with the network panel, let&rsquo;s explore the primary kind of request you&rsquo;re already used to making - requests originating from a browser.  Every time you use a browser to browse the Internet, you are creating a series of HTTP (or HTTPS) requests that travel across the networks between you and a web server, which responds to your requests.</p>
<p>When you type in an address in your browser (or click a hyperlink), this initiates a HTTP request against the server located at that address. Ideally, the request succeeds, and you are sent the webpage you requested. As the browser parses that webpage, it may also request additional resources linked in that page (such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files).</p>
<p>To help illustrate how these requests are made, we&rsquo;ll once again turn to our developer tools.  Open the example page <a href='https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/examples/2.5.1/index.html' target='_blank'>this link</a>.  On that tab, open your developer tools with <code>CTRL + SHIFT + i</code> or by right-clicking the page and selecting &ldquo;Inspect&rdquo; from the context menu.  Then choose the &ldquo;Network&rdquo; tab:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-f6fbe6dececa775913f87ba41a26a8b1" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/2.4.1.png" alt="Selecting the network tab in the developer tools" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-f6fbe6dececa775913f87ba41a26a8b1">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/2.4.1.png" alt="Selecting the network tab in the developer tools" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>The network tab displays details about each request the browser makes.  Initially it will probably be empty, as it does not log requests while not open.  Try refreshing the page - you should see it populate with information:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-8ad02907e529c7e14a0d0c5f7daa2a6f" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/2.4.2.png" alt="The populated network tab" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-8ad02907e529c7e14a0d0c5f7daa2a6f">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/2.4.2.png" alt="The populated network tab" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>The first entry is the page itself - the HTML file.  But then you should see entries for <em>site.css</em>, <em>brazil.gif</em>, <em>fiber-4814456_960_720.jpg</em>, <em>jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js</em>, and <em>site.js</em>.  Each of these entries represents an additional resource the browser fetched from the web in order to display the page.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the two images <em>brazil.gif</em> and <em>fiber-4814456_960_720.jpg</em>.  These correspond to <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags in the HTML file:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Paper scene from the film Brazil&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;brazil.gif&#34;</span>/&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Fiber optic cables&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/02/03/00/12/fiber-4814456_960_720.jpg&#34;</span>/&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        </span></span></code></pre></div><p>The important takeaway here is that the image is requested <em>separately</em> from the HTML file.  As the browser reads the page and encounters the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, it makes an additional request for the resource supplied in its <code>src</code> attribute.  When that second request finishes, the downloaded image is added to the web page.</p>
<p>Notice too that while one image was on our webserver, the other is retrieved from <a href="https://pixabay.com" target="_blank">Pixabay.com</a>
&rsquo;s server.</p>
<p>You can use the network tab to help debug issues with resources.  Click on one of the requested resources, and it will open up details about the request:</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<p>Notice that it reports the status code along with details about the request and response, and provides a preview of the requested resource.</p>

<h1 id="status-codes">Status Codes</h1>

<p>A HTTP response includes a status code - a numeric code and a human-readable description. The codes themselves are 3-digit numbers, with the first number indicating a general category the response status falls into.  Essentially, the status code indicates that the request is being fulfilled, or the reason it cannot be.</p>
<h3 id="1xx-status-codes">1XX Status Codes</h3>
<p>Codes falling in the 100&rsquo;s provide some kind of information, often in response to a <code>HEAD</code> or upgrade request. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for a full list.</p>
<h3 id="2xx-status-codes">2XX Status Codes</h3>
<p>Codes in the 200&rsquo;s indicate success in some form.  These include:</p>
<p><strong><code>200 OK</code></strong> A status of 200 indicates the request was successful.  This is by far the most common response.</p>
<p><strong><code>201 Created</code></strong> Issued in response to a successful POST request, indicates the resource POSTed to the server has been created.</p>
<p><strong><code>202 Accepted</code></strong> Indicates the request was received but not yet acted upon.  This is used for batch-style processes.  An example you may be familiar with is submitting a DARS report request - the DARS server, upon receiving one, adds it to a list of reports to process and then sends a <code>202</code> response indicating it was added to the list, and should be available at some future point.</p>
<p>There are additional 200 status codes.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for a full list.</p>
<h3 id="3xx-status-codes">3XX Status Codes</h3>
<p>Codes in the 300&rsquo;s indicate redirects.  These should be used in conjunction with a <code>Location</code> response header to notify the user-agent where to redirect. The three most common are:</p>
<p><strong><code>301 Moved Permanently</code></strong> Indicates the requested resource is now permanently available at a different URI.  The new URI should be provided in the response, and the user-agent may want to update bookmarks and caches.</p>
<p><strong><code>302 Found</code></strong> Also redirects the user to a different URI, but this redirect should be considered temporary and the original URI used for further requests.</p>
<p><strong><code>304 Not Modified</code></strong> Indicates the requested resource has not changed, and therefore the user-agent can use its cached version. By sending a 304, the server does not need to send a potentially large resource and consume unnecessary bandwidth.</p>
<p>There are additional 300 status codes.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for a full list.</p>
<h3 id="4xx-status-codes">4XX Status Codes</h3>
<p>Codes in the 400&rsquo;s indicate client errors.  These center around badly formatted requests and authentication status.</p>
<p><strong><code>400 Bad Request</code></strong> is a request that is poorly formatted and cannot be understood.</p>
<p><strong><code>401 Unauthorized</code></strong> means the user has not been authenticated, and needs to log in.</p>
<p><strong><code>403 Forbidden</code></strong> means the user does not have permissions to access the requested resource.</p>
<p><strong><code>404 Not Found</code></strong> means the requested resource is not found on the server.</p>
<p>There are <em>many</em> additional 400 status codes.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for a full list.</p>
<h3 id="5xx-status-codes">5XX Status Codes</h3>
<p>Status codes in the 500&rsquo;s indicate server errors.</p>
<p><strong><code>500 Server Error</code></strong> is a generic code for &ldquo;something went wrong in the server.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><code>501 Not Implemented</code></strong> indicates the server does not know how to handle the request method.</p>
<p><strong><code>503 Service Unavailable</code></strong> indicates the server is not able to handle the request at the moment due to being down, overloaded, or some other temporary condition.</p>
<p>There are additional 500 status codes.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>

<h1 id="request-methods">Request Methods</h1>

<p>When a web client like a browser makes a request, it must specify the <em>request method</em>, indicating what kind of request this is (sometimes we refer to the method as a <strong>HTTP Verb</strong>).</p>
<p>The two most common are <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> requests, as these are typically the only kinds supported by browsers.  Other request methods include PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, which are typically used by other kinds of web clients.  We&rsquo;ll focus on just GET and POST requests here.</p>
<h4 id="get">GET</h4>
<p>A <em>GET</em> request seeks to retrieve a specific resource from the web server - often an HTML document or binary file.  GET requests typically have no body and are simply used to retrieve data.  If the request is successful, the response will typically provide the requested resource in its body.</p>
<h4 id="post">POST</h4>
<p>The <em>POST</em> request submits an entity to the resource, i.e. uploading a file or form data.  It typically will have a body, which is the upload or form.</p>

<h1 id="request-headers">Request Headers</h1>

<p>Request headers take the form of key-value pairs, and represent specific aspects of the request.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code></pre></div><p>Indicates that the browser knows how to accepted content compressed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip" target="_blank">Gzip format</a>
.</p>
<p>Note that request headers are a subset of <em>message headers</em> that apply specifically to requests.  There are also message headers that apply only to HTTP responses, and some that apply to both.</p>
<p>As HTTP is intended as an extensible protocol, there are a <em>lot</em> of potential headers.  IANA maintains the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml" target="_blank">official list of message headers</a>
 as well as <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml" target="_blank">a list of proposed message headers</a>
.  You can also find a categorized list in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
</p>
<p>While there are many possible request headers, some of the more commonly used are:</p>
<p><strong>Accept</strong> Specifies the types a server can send back, its value is a MIME type.</p>
<p><strong>Accept-Charset</strong> Specifies the character set a browser understands.</p>
<p><strong>Accept-Encoding</strong> Informs the server about encoding algorithms the client can process (most typically compression types)</p>
<p><strong>Accept-Language</strong> Hints to the server what language content should be sent in.</p>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong> Supplies credentials to authenticate the user to the server.  Will be covered in the authentication chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Content-Length</strong> The length of the request body sent, in octets</p>
<p><strong>Content-Type</strong> The MIME type of the request body</p>
<p><strong>Content-Encoding</strong> The encoding method of the request body</p>
<p><strong>Cookie</strong> Sends a site cookie - see the section on cookies later</p>
<p><strong>User-Agent</strong> A string identifying the agent making the request (typically a browser name and version)</p>

<p>Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) alongside Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) formed the core of Sir Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s world-wide web.  As the name implies, HTTP is a <em>markup language</em>, one that combines the text of what is being said with instructions on how to display it.</p>
<p>The other aspect of HTML is its <em>hyper-text</em> nature.  Hyper-text refers to text that links to additional resources - primarily the links in the document, but also embedded multimedia.</p>
<p>This ability to author structured pages that linked to other structured pages with a single mouse click is at the heart of the World-Wide-Web.</p>

<h1 id="html-element-structure">HTML Element Structure</h1>

<p>HTML was built from the SGML (Structured Generalized Markup Language) standard, which provides the concept of &ldquo;tags&rdquo; to provide markup and structure within a text document.  Each element in HTML is defined by a unique opening and closing tag, which in turn are surrounded by angle brackets (&lt;&gt;).</p>
<p>For example, a top-level heading in HTML would be written:</p>
<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>
<p>And render:</p>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the <em>opening tag</em> and the <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is the closing tag.  The name of the tag appears immediately within the &lt;&gt; of the opening tag, and within the closing tag proceeded by a forward slash (/).  Between the opening tag and closing tag is the <em>content</em> of the element.  This can be text (as in the case above) or it can be another HTML element.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello &lt;i&gt;World&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>
<p>Renders:</p>
<h1>Hello <i>World</i></h1>
<h2 id="nesting-elements">Nesting Elements</h2>
<p>An element nested inside another element in this way is called a <em>child</em> of the element it is nested in.  The containing element is a <em>parent</em>.  If more than one tag is contained within the parent, the children are referred to as <em>siblings</em> of one another.  Finally, a element nested several layers deep inside another element is called a <em>descendant</em> of that element, and that element is called an <em>ancestor</em>.</p>
<h2 id="matching-tags">Matching Tags</h2>
<p>Every opening tag <strong>must</strong> have a matching closing tag.  Moreover, nested tags must be matched in order, much like when you use parenthesis and curly braces in programming.  While whitespace is ignored by HTML interpreters, best developer practices use indentation to indicate nesting, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    This is a paragraph, followed by an unordered list...
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item #1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item #2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item #3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div><p>Getting tags out of order results in invalid HTML, which may be rendered unpredictably in different browsers.</p>
<h2 id="void-elements">Void Elements</h2>
<p>Also, some elements are not allowed to contain content, and should not be written with an end tag, like the break character:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></p>
<p>However, there is a more strict version of HTML called XHTML which is based on XML (another SGML extension).  In XHTML void tags are self-closing, and must include a <code>/</code> before the last <code>&gt;</code>, i.e.:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br/&gt;</code></p>
<p>In practice, most browsers will interpret <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> interchangeably, and you will see many websites and even textbooks use one or the other strategy (sometimes both on the same page).  But as a computer scientist, you should strive to use the appropriate form based type of document you are creating.</p>
<h2 id="tag-name-case">Tag Name Case</h2>
<p>Similarly, by the standards, HTML is case-insensitive when evaluating tag names, but the W3C recommends using lowercase characters.  In XHTML tag names <strong>must</strong> be in lowercase, and React&rsquo;s JSX format uses lowercase to distinguish between HTML elements and React components. Thus, it makes sense to always use lowercase tag names.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>XHTML is intended to allow HTML to be interpreted by XML parsers, hence the more strict formatting. While it is nearly identical to HTML, there are important structural differences that need to be followed for it to be valid.  And since the point of XHTML is to make it more easily parsed by machines, these <strong>must</strong> be followed to meet that goal. Like HTML, the XHTML standard is maintained by W3C: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/</a>
.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>In addition to the tag name, tags can have <em>attributes</em> embedded within them. These are key-value pairs that can modify the corresponding HTML element in some way.  For example, an image tag <em>must</em> have a <code>src</code> (source) attribute that provides a URL where the image data to display can be found:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Light_Bulb_or_Idea_Flat_Icon_Vector.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Light Bulb&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>This allows the image to be downloaded and displayed within the browser:</p>
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/Light_Bulb_or_Idea_Flat_Icon_Vector.svg" alt="Light Bulb">
<p>Note that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is another void tag.  Also, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements should always have an <code>alt</code> attribute set - this is text that is displayed if the image cannot be downloaded, and is also read by a screen reader when viewed by the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Attributes come in the form of key-value pairs, with the key and value separated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>) and the individual attributes and the tag name separated by whitespace.  Attributes can only appear in an opening or void tag.  Some attributes (like <code>readonly</code>) do not need a value.</p>
<p>There should be no spaces between the attribute key, the equal sign (<code>=</code>), and the attribute value.  Attribute values should be quoted using single or double quotes if they contain a space character, single quote, or double quote character.</p>
<p>Additionally, while there are specific attributes defined within the HTML standard that browsers know how to interpret, specific technologies like Angular and React add their own, custom attributes.  Any attribute a browser does not know is simply ignored by the browser.</p>

<h1 id="html-document-structure">HTML Document Structure</h1>

<p>When authoring an HTML page, HTML elements should be organized into an <em>HTML Document</em>.  This format is defined in the HTML standard.  HTML that does not follow this format are technically invalid, and may not be interpreted and rendered correctly by all browsers.  Accordingly, it is important to follow the standard.</p>
<p>The basic structure of a valid HTML5 document is:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;!doctype HTML&gt;
&lt;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title Goes Here&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Page body and tags go here...&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll walk through each section of the page in detail.</p>
<h2 id="doctype">Doctype</h2>
<p>The SGML standard that HTML is based on requires a <code>!doctype</code> tag to appear as the first tag on the page. The doctype indicates what kind of document the file represents. For HTML5, the doctype is simply <em>HTML</em>.  Note the doctype is not an element - it has no closing tag and is not self-closing.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>For SGML, the doctype normally includes a URL pointing at a definition for the specific type of document.  For example, in HTML4, it would have been <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;</code>.  HTML5 broke with the standard by only requiring HTML be included, making the doctype much easier to remember and type.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="html-element">HTML Element</h2>
<p>The next element should be an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.  It should include all other elements in the document, and its closing tag should be the last tag on the page. It is best practice to include a <code>lang</code> attribute to indicate what language is used in the document - here we used <code>&quot;en&quot;</code> for English.  The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element should only contain two children - a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in that order.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>The list of valid langauge subtags are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <a href="https://www.iana.org/" target="_blank">(IANA)</a>
, which also oversees domains and IP addresses.  The full list can be reached <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry" target="_blank">here</a>
.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="the-head-element">The Head Element</h2>
<p>The next element is the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.  A valid HTML document will only have one head element, and it will always be the first child of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.  The head section contains metadata about the document - information about the document that is not rendered in the document itself.  This typically consists of <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> elements, as well as a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.  Traditionally, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements would also appear here, though current best practice places them as the last children of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<h3 id="the-title-element">The Title Element</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element should always have exactly one child <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, which contains the title of the page (as text; the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element should <strong>never</strong> contain other HTML elements).  This title is typically displayed in the browser tab.</p>
<h2 id="the-body-element">The Body Element</h2>
<p>The next element is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.  A valid HTML document will only have one body element, and it will always be the second child of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.  The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag contains all the HTML elements that make up the page.  It can be empty, though that makes for a very boring page.</p>

<h1 id="flow-model">Flow Model</h1>

<p>Given that the role of HTML is <em>markup</em>, i.e. providing structure and formatting to text, HTML elements can broadly be categorized into two categories depending on how they affect the flow of text - inline and block.</p>
<p>Inline elements referred to elements that maintained the flow of text, i.e. the <em>bring attention to</em> (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) element used in a paragraph of text, would bold the text without breaking the flow:</p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;The quick brown &lt;b&gt;fox&lt;/b&gt; lept over the log&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<p>The quick brown <b>fox</b> lept over the log</p>
<p>In contrast, block elements break the flow of text. For example, the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element used to inject a quote into the middle of the same paragraph:</p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox &lt;blockquote&gt;What does the fox say? - YLVIS&lt;/blockquote&gt; lept over the log&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<p>The quick brown fox <blockquote>What does the fox say? - YLVIS</blockquote> lept over the log</p>
<p>While HTML elements default to either block or inline behavior, this can be changed with the CSS <code>display</code> property.</p>

<h1 id="tables">Tables</h1>

<p>Tables were amongst the first addition to HTML (along with images), as they were necessary for the primary role of early HTML, disseminating research.</p>
<p>A table requires a <em>lot</em> of elements to be nested in a specific manner.  It is best expressed through an example:</p>

<p>Tables should <em>only</em> be used for displaying tabular data.  There was a time, not long ago, when early web developers used them to create layouts by cutting images into segments and inserting them into table cells.  <strong>This is very bad practice!</strong>  It will not display as expected in all browsers, and wreaks havoc with screen readers for the visually impaired.  Instead, pages should be laid out with CSS, as is discussed in the CSS layouts section.</p>

<h1 id="forms">Forms</h1>

<p>Forms were also amongst the first additions to the HTML standard, and provide the ability to submit data to a web server.  A web form is composed of <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and similar elements nested within a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="the-form-element">The Form Element</h2>
<p>The form element primarily is used to organize input elements and specify how they should be submitted.  In its simplest form, it is simply a tag that other elements are nested within:</p>
<p><code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></p>
<p>However, it can be modified with a number of attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>action</strong> The <code>action</code> attribute specifies the url that this form data should be sent to. By default, it is the page the form exists on (i.e. if the form appears on <a href="http://foo.com/bar" target="_blank">http://foo.com/bar</a>
, then it will submit to <a href="http://foo.com/bar%29" target="_blank">http://foo.com/bar)</a>
.  The url can be relative to the current page, absolute, or even on a different webserver.  See the discussion of URLs in the HTTP section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>enctype</strong> The <code>enctype</code> attribute specifies the format that form data will be submitted in.  The most common values are <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> (the default), which serializes the key/value pairs using the urlencoding strategy, and <code>multipart/form-data</code>, which uses the multipart encoding scheme, and can interweave binary (file) data into the submission.  These encoding strategies are discussed more thoroughly in the chapter on submitting form data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>method</strong> The <code>method</code> attribute specifies the HTTP method used to submit the form.  The values are usually <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>. If the method is not specified, it will be a <code>GET</code> request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>target</strong> The target attribute specifies how the server response to the form submission will be displayed. By default, it loads in the current frame (the <code>_self</code>) value.  A value of <code>_blank</code> will load the response in a new tab.  If <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements are being used, there are additional values that work within <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> sets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-input-element">The Input Element</h2>
<p>Most inputs in a form are variations of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, specified with the <code>type</code> attribute.  Many additional specific types were introduced in the HTML5 specification, and may not be available in older browsers (in which case, they will be rendered as a <em>text</em> type input).  Currently available types are (an asterisk indicate a HTML5-defined type):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>button</strong>: A push button with no default behavior.</li>
<li><strong>checkbox</strong>: A check box allowing single values to be selected/deselected.  It has an extra attributed <code>checked</code>, which is a boolean specifying if it is checked.</li>
<li><strong>color*</strong>: A control for specifying a color.</li>
<li><strong>date*:</strong> A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time).</li>
<li><strong>datetime-local*</strong>: A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone.</li>
<li><strong>email:</strong> HTML5 A field for editing an e-mail address.</li>
<li><strong>file:</strong> A control that lets the user select a file. Use the accept attribute to define the types of files that the control can select.</li>
<li><strong>hidden:</strong> A control that is not displayed but whose value is submitted to the server.</li>
<li><strong>image:</strong> A graphical submit button. You must use the src attribute to define the source of the image and the alt attribute to define alternative text. You can use the height and width attributes to define the size of the image in pixels.</li>
<li><strong>month*:</strong> A control for entering a month and year, with no time zone.</li>
<li><strong>number*:</strong> A control for entering a number.</li>
<li><strong>password:</strong> A single-line text field whose value is obscured.</li>
<li><strong>radio:</strong> A radio button, allowing a single value to be selected out of multiple choices.</li>
<li><strong>range*:</strong> A control for entering a number whose exact value is not important.</li>
<li><strong>reset:</strong> A button that resets the contents of the form to default values.</li>
<li><strong>search*:</strong> A single-line text field for entering search strings. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.</li>
<li><strong>submit:</strong> A button that submits the form.</li>
<li><strong>tel*:</strong> A control for entering a telephone number.</li>
<li><strong>text:</strong> A single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.</li>
<li><strong>time*:</strong> A control for entering a time value with no time zone.</li>
<li><strong>url*:</strong> A field for entering a URL.</li>
<li><strong>week*:</strong> A control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a week number with no time zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the <em>type</em> attribute, some other commonly used input attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> The name of the attribute, which is used to identify the submitted value (the name and value attributes define a key/value pair)</li>
<li><strong>value</strong> The input&rsquo;s current value</li>
<li><strong>placeholder</strong> A string to display in the input until a value is entered (typically used as a prompt).  The placeholder is never submitted as a value.</li>
<li><strong>readonly</strong> A boolean attribute that when true, indicates the input value cannot be changed</li>
<li><strong>required</strong> A boolean value indicating that the input is required to have a value before it can be submitted.</li>
<li><strong>tabindex</strong> Indicates the order in which inputs can be reached by hitting the tab key.  For dense input forms, this can be important.</li>
<li><strong>disabled</strong> A boolean value that when true, means the input is disabled (does not submit a value, cannot be interacted with, and is grayed out)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-input-elements">Other &ldquo;Input&rdquo; Elements</h2>
<p>In addition to the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, some other elements exist that provide input-type functionality within a form, and implement the same attributes as an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.  These are:</p>
<h3 id="textarea">Textarea</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element provides a method for entering larger chunks of text than a <code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code> does.  Most importantly, it preserves line-breaks (the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code> removes them).  Instead of using the <code>value</code> attribute, the current value appears inside the opening and closing tags, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">textarea</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;exampleText&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  This text is displayed within the textarea
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">textarea</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition, the <code>rows</code> and <code>cols</code> attribute can be used to specify the size of the textarea in characters.</p>
<h3 id="select">Select</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element allows you to define a drop-down list.  It can contain as children, <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;optgroup&gt;</code> elements.  The <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element should have its <code>name</code> attribute specified, and each <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element should have a unique <code>value</code> attribute.  The selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>&rsquo;s value is then submitted with the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>&rsquo;s name as a key/value pair.</p>
<p>Each <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element should also have a closing tag, and its child text is what is displayed to the user.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;optgroup&gt;</code> provides a way of nesting <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements under a category identifier (a <code>label</code> attribute specified on the <code>&lt;optgroup&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>An example <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> using these features is:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">select</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;headgear&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;none&#34;</span>&gt;None&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">optgroup</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">label</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hats&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ball cap&#34;</span>&gt;Ball Cap&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;derby&#34;</span>&gt;Derby&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;fedora&#34;</span>&gt;Fedora&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">optgroup</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">optgroup</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Ceremonial&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;crown&#34;</span>&gt;Crown&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mitre&#34;</span>&gt;Mitre&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">option</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;war bonnet&#34;</span>&gt;War Bonnet&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">option</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">optgroup</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">select</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, multiple selections can be allowed by specifying a <code>multiple</code> attribute as <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>
<p>In addition to inputs, a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> often uses <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements to help identify the inputs and their function.  A label will typically have its <code>for</code> attribute set to match the <code>name</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> it corresponds to.  When connected in this fashion, clicking the label will give focus to the input.  Also, when the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;</code>, clicking the label will also toggle the <code>checked</code> attribute of the checkbox.</p>
<h2 id="fieldsets">Fieldsets</h2>
<p>Finally, the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> element can be used to organize controls and labels into a single subcontainer within the form.  Much like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, this can be used to apply specific styles to the contained elements.</p>

<h1 id="common-html-elements">Common HTML Elements</h1>

<p>This page details some of the most commonly used HTML elements. For a full reference, see MDN&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">HTML Element Reference</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="document-level-elements">Document-Level Elements</h2>
<p>These elements describe the basic structure of the HTML document.</p>
<h3 id="lthtmlgt">&lt;html&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element contains the entire HTML document.  It should have exactly two children, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements, appearing in that order.</p>
<h3 id="ltheadgt">&lt;head&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element contains any metadata describing the document.  The most common children elements are <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ltbodygt">&lt;body&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element should be the second child of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.  It contains the actual rendered content of the page, typically as nested HTML elements and text.  Elements that appear in the body can define structure, organize content, embed media, and play many other roles.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-elements">Metadata Elements</h2>
<p>These elements add properties to the document.</p>
<h3 id="ltlinkgt">&lt;link&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element links to an external resource using the <code>href</code> attribute and defines that resource&rsquo;s relationship with the document with the <code>rel</code> attibute.</p>
<p>This is most commonly used to link a stylesheet which will modify how the page is rendered by the browser (see the chapter on CSS).  A stylesheet link takes the form:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href=&quot;path-to-stylesheet.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>It can also be used to link a favicon (the icon that appears on your browser tab):</p>
<p><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;</code></p>
<h3 id="ltmetagt">&lt;meta&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements is used to describe metadata not covered by other elements.  In the early days, its most common use was to list keywords for the website for search engines to use:</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta keywords=&quot;html html5 web development webdev&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>However, this was greatly abused and search engines have stopped relying on them.  One of the most common uses today is to set the viewport to the size of the rendering device for responsive design (see the chapter on responsive design):</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>Also, best practice is to author HTML documents in utf-8 character format and specify that encoding with a metadata tag with the <code>charset</code> attribute:</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<h3 id="ltstylegt">&lt;style&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>style</code> element allows for embedding CSS text directly into the head section of the HTML page.  The Separation of Concerns discussion discusses the appropriateness of using this approach.</p>
<h3 id="lttitlegt">&lt;title&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element should only appear once in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, and its content should be text (no HTML elements).  It specifies the title of the document.  In modern browsers, the title is displayed on the browser tab displaying the document. In earlier browsers, it would appear in the window title bar.</p>
<h2 id="sectioning-elements">Sectioning Elements</h2>
<p>Many HTML Elements help define the structure of the document by breaking it into sections. These are intended to hold other elements and text. These elements are <em>block</em> type elements.</p>
<h3 id="headings">headings</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> elements are headings and subheadings with six possible levels of nesting.  They are used to enclose the title of the section.</p>
<h3 id="ltmaingt">&lt;main&gt;</h3>
<p>A <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element identifies the content most central in the page. There should be only one per page (or, if multiple main elements are used, the others should have their <code>visible</code> attribute set to false).</p>
<h3 id="ltaside-gt">&lt;aside &gt;</h3>
<p>An <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element identifies content separate from the main focus of the page. It can be used for callouts, advertisements, and the like.</p>
<h3 id="ltarticlegt">&lt;article&gt;</h3>
<p>An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element identifies a stand-alone piece of content.  Unlike an aside, it is intended for syndication (reprinting) in other forms.</p>
<h3 id="ltheadergt">&lt;header&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element identifies a header for the page, often containing the site banner, navigation, etc.</p>
<h3 id="ltfootergt">&lt;footer&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element identifies a footer for the page, often containing copyright and contact information.</p>
<h3 id="ltnavgt">&lt;nav&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element typically contains navigation links and/or menus.</p>
<h3 id="ltsectiongt">&lt;section&gt;</h3>
<p>A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is a general-purpose container for sectioning a page where a more specific container does not make sense.</p>
<h2 id="text-content">Text Content</h2>
<p>These HTML elements are used to organize text content.  Each of these is a <em>block element</em>, meaning it breaks up the flow of text on the page.</p>
<h3 id="ltblockquotegt">&lt;blockquote&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> is used to contain a long quotation.</p>
<h3 id="ltfiguregt">&lt;figure&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> is used to contain a figure (typically a <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or other media element).</p>
<h3 id="ltfigcaptiongt">&lt;figcaption&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> provides a caption for a figure</p>
<h3 id="lthrgt">&lt;hr&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> provides a horizontal rule (line) to separate text.</p>
<h3 id="lists">lists</h3>
<p>There are three types of lists available in HTML, ordered, unordered, and definition.  Ordered lists number their contents, and consist of list item elements (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) nested in an ordered list element (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>).  Unordered lists are bulleted, and consist of list item elements (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) nested in an unordered list element (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>). List items can contain any kind of HTML elements, not just text.</p>
<p>Definition lists nest a definition term (<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>) and its corresponding definition (<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>) inside a definition list (<code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>) element.  While rarely used, they can be handy when you want to provide lists of definitions (as in a glossary) in a way a search engine will recognize.</p>
<h3 id="ltdivgt">&lt;div&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element provides a wrapper around text content that is normally used to attach styles to.</p>
<h3 id="ltpregt">&lt;pre&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag informs the browser that its content has been preformatted, and its contents should be displayed exactly as written (i.e. whitespace is respected, and angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) are rendered rather than interpreted as HTML. It is often used in conjunction with a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element to display source code within a webpage.</p>
<h2 id="inline-text-elements">Inline Text Elements</h2>
<p>The following elements modify nested text while maintaining the flow of the page. As the name suggests, these are <em>inline</em> type elements.</p>
<h3 id="ltagt">&lt;a&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor element is used to link to another document on the web (i.e. &lsquo;anchoring&rsquo; it).  This element is what makes HTML hyper-text, so clearly it is important.  It should always have a source (<code>src</code>) attribute defined (use <code>&quot;#&quot;</code> if you are overriding its behavior with JavaScript).</p>
<h3 id="text-callouts">text callouts</h3>
<p>A number of elements seek to draw specific attention to a snippet of text, including <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code></p>
<h4 id="ltstronggt">&lt;strong&gt;</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element indicates the text is <em>important</em> in some way. Typically browsers will render its contents in boldface.</p>
<h4 id="ltemgt">&lt;em&gt;</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element indicates <em>stress emphasis</em> on the text.  Typically a browser will render it in italics.</p>
<h4 id="ltmarkgt">&lt;mark&gt;</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> element indicates text of specific <em>relevance</em>.  Typically the text appears highlighted.</p>
<h4 id="ltbgt">&lt;b&gt;</h4>
<p>The <em>bring to attention</em> element (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) strives to bring attention to the text. It lacks the semantic meaning of the other callouts, and typically is rendered as boldface (in early versions of HTML, it referred to bold).</p>
<h4 id="ltigt">&lt;i&gt;</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element sets off the contained text for some reason other than emphasis. It typically renders as italic (in early versions of HTML, the i referred to italics).</p>
<h3 id="ltbrgt">&lt;br&gt;</h3>
<p>The break element (<code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) inserts a line break into the text.  This is important as all whitespace in the text of an HTML document is collapsed into a single space when interpreted by a browser.</p>
<h3 id="ltcodegt">&lt;code&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element indicates the contained text is computer code.</p>
<h3 id="ltspangt">&lt;span&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is the inline equivalent of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element; it is used primarily to attach CSS rules to nested content.</p>
<h2 id="media-elements">Media Elements</h2>
<p>A number of elements bring media into the page.</p>
<h3 id="ltimggt">&lt;img&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element represents an image.  It should have a source (<code>src</code>) attribute defined, consisting of a URL where the image data can be retrieved, and an alternative text (<code>alt</code>) attribute with text to be displayed when the image cannot be loaded or when the element is read by a screen reader.</p>
<h3 id="ltaudiogt">&lt;audio&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element represents audio data.  It should also have a source (<code>src</code>) attribute to provide the location of the video data.  Alternatively, it can contain multiple <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements defining alternative forms of the video data.</p>
<h3 id="ltvideogt">&lt;video&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element represents a video.  It should also have a source (<code>src</code>) attribute to provide the location of the video data.  Alternatively, it can contain multiple <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements defining alternative forms of the audio data.</p>
<h3 id="ltsourcegt">&lt;source&gt;</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element specifies one form of multimedia data, and should be nested inside a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element.  Providing multiple sources in this way allows the browser to use the first one it understands (as most browsers do not support all possible media formats, this allows you to serve the broadest possible audience).  Each <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element should have a source attribute (<code>src</code>) defining where its multimedia data can be located, as well as a <code>type</code> attribute defining what format the data is in.</p>

<h1 id="document-object-model">Document Object Model</h1>

<p>The Document Object Model (or DOM) is a data structure representing the content of a web page, created by the browser as it parses the website. The browser then makes this data structure accessible to scripts running on the page.  The DOM is essentially a tree composed of objects representing the HTML elements and text on the page.</p>
<p>Consider this HTML:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term &#34;document&#34; is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.

<h3 id="the-dom-tree-and-developer-tools">The DOM Tree and Developer Tools</h3>
<p>Most browsers also expose the DOM tree through their developer tools.  Try opening the example page in Chrome or your favorite browser using <a href='https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/examples/3.8.1/index.html' target='_blank'>this link</a>.</p>
<p>Now open the developer tools for your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome</strong> <code>CTRL + SHIFT + i</code> or right-click and select &lsquo;Inspect&rsquo; from the context menu.</li>
<li><strong>Edge</strong> <code>CTRL + SHIFT + i</code> or right-click and select &lsquo;Inspect element&rsquo; from the context menu.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox</strong> <code>CTRL + SHIFT + i</code> or right-click and select &lsquo;Inspect Element&rsquo; from the context menu.</li>
<li><strong>Safari</strong> Developer tools must be enabled.  See the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac" target="_blank">Safari User Guide</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see a new panel open in your browser, and under its &rsquo;elements&rsquo; tab the DOM tree is displayed:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-2a7d94725136387287ae1daccaa078a0" class="lightbox-link">

</a></p>
<p>Collapsed nodes can be expanded by clicking on the arrow next to them.<br>
Try moving your mouse around the nodes in the DOM tree, and you&rsquo;ll see the corresponding element highlighted in the page.  You can also <em>dynamically edit</em> the DOM tree from the elements tab by right-clicking on a node.</p>
<p>Try right-clicking on the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> node and selecting &rsquo;edit text&rsquo;.  Change the text to &ldquo;Hello Browser DOM&rdquo;.  See how it changes the page?</p>
<p>The page is rendered from the DOM, so editing the DOM changes how the page appears.  However, the initial structure of the DOM is derived from the loaded HTML.  This means if we refresh the page, any changes we made to the DOM using the developer tools will be lost, and the page will return to its original state.  Give it a try - hit the refresh button.</p>

<p>For convenience, this textbook will use the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome browser</a>
 for all developer tool reference images and discussions, but the other browsers offer much of the same functionality.  If you prefer to use a different browser&rsquo;s web tools, look up the details in that browser&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now seen how the browser creates the DOM tree by parsing the HTML document and that DOM tree is used to render the page.  We&rsquo;ll revisit this concept in the chapters on <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/4-css/">CSS</a>
 and <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/">JavaScript</a>

<p>Style sheets are collections of rules for modifying how a SGML document appears.  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the specific implementation adopted by the W3C for HTML.</p>
<p>The core concept of CSS is that defines rules altering  the appearance of HTML elements that can be selectively applied.  These rules are held in a document (the style sheet) and are applied in a well-defined priority order (the <em>cascading</em> part of CSS).</p>
<p>As of CSS Version 3, CSS technologies were split into separate <em>modules</em> allowing them to be revised and maintained separately.  Each module adds or extends features to those defined in CSS Version 2, in order to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>

<h1 id="css-rules">CSS Rules</h1>

<p>CSS properties consist of key-value pairs separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).  For example:</p>
<p><code>color: red</code></p>
<p>indicates that the styled HTML elements should be given a red color.</p>
<p>Multiple properties are separated by semicolons (<code>;</code>), i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>color: red;
background-color: green;</code></pre></div><p>Rules are CSS properties grouped within curly braces (<code>{}</code>) and proceeded by a CSS selector to identify the HTML element(s) they should be applied to:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>p {
  color: red;
  background-color: green;
}</code></pre></div><p>In this example, all paragraph elements (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) should have red text on a green background (how festive!).</p>
<p style="color: red; background-color: green;">
  And difficult to read!
</p>
<h2 id="short-forms">Short Forms</h2>
<p>Some properties have multiple forms allowing for some abbreviation.  For example, the CSS property:</p>
<p><code>border: 1px solid black</code></p>
<p>is a short form for three separate border-related properties:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: black;</code></pre></div><h2 id="experimental-features-and-prefixes">Experimental Features and Prefixes</h2>
<p>As new features are considered for inclusion in CSS, browsers may adopt experimental implementations.  To separate these from potentially differing future interpretations, these experimental properties are typically <em>prefixed</em> with a browser-specific code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-webkit-</strong> Webkit Browsers (Chrome, Safari, newer Opera  versions, and iOS)</li>
<li><strong>-moz-</strong> Mozilla</li>
<li><strong>-ms-</strong> Microsoft browsers (IE, Edge)</li>
<li><strong>-o-</strong> Older Opera versions</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, most browsers adopted the <code>box-shadow</code> property before it achieved candidate status, so to use it in the Mozilla browser at that point you would use:</p>
<p><code>-moz-box-shadow: black 2px 2px 2px</code></p>
<p>To make it work for multiple browsers, and future browsers when it was officially adopted, you might use:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>-webkit-box-shadow: black 2px 2px 2px;
-moz-box-shadow: black 2px 2px 2px;
-ms-box-shadow: black 2px 2px 2px;
box-shadow: black 2px 2px 2px;</code></pre></div><p>The browser will ignore any properties it does not recognize, hence in Chrome 4, the <code>-webkit-box-shadow</code> will be used and the rest ignored, while in Chrome 10+ the <code>box-shadow</code> property will be used.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>You should always place the not-prefixed version last, to override the prefixed version if the browser supports the official property.</p>
</div>

<h1 id="css-selectors">CSS Selectors</h1>

<p>In the example from the previous section, we saw:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>p {
  color: red;
  background-color: green;
}</code></pre></div><p>Here the <code>p</code> is a <em>CSS Selector</em>, which tells us what elements on the page the CSS rules should be applied to.</p>
<h2 id="simple-selectors">Simple Selectors</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS selectors come in several flavors, which we&rsquo;ll take a look at next.  Simple selectors are a string composed of alphanumeric characters, dashes (<code>-</code>), and underscores (<code>_</code>).  Certain selectors also use additional special characters.</p>
<h3 id="type-selector">Type Selector</h3>
<p>Type selectors apply to a specific type of HTML element.  The <code>p</code> in our example is a type selector matching the paragraph element.</p>
<p>A type selector is simply the name of the HTML element it applies to - the tag name from our discussion of HTML element structure.</p>
<h3 id="class-selector">Class Selector</h3>
<p>A class selector is a proceeded by a period (<code>.</code>), and applies to any HTML element that has a matching <code>class</code> attribute.  For example, the CSS rule:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">danger</span> { 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>would apply to both the paragraph and button elements:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">h1</span>&gt;Hello&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">h1</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;danger&#34;</span>&gt;You are in danger&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">button</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;danger&#34;</span>&gt;Don&#39;t click me!&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">button</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>as both have the class <code>danger</code>.  A HTML element can have multiple classes applied, just separate each class name with a space:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;danger big-text&#34;</span>&gt;I have two classes!&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="id-selector">ID Selector</h3>
<p>An ID selector is proceeded by a hash (<code>#</code>) and applies to the HTML element that has a matching <code>id</code> attribute. Hence:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;lead&#34;</span>&gt;This paragraph has an id of &#34;lead&#34;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>would be matched by:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>#lead {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-size</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">pt</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is important to note that the <code>id</code> attribute <em>should be unique within the page</em>.  If you give the same id to multiple elements, the results will be unpredictable (and doing so is invalid HTML).</p>
<h3 id="universal-selector">Universal Selector</h3>
<p>The asterisk (<code>*</code>) is the universal selector, and applies to all elements.  It is often used as part of a <em>reset</em> - CSS rules appearing at the beginning of a CSS document to remove browser-specific styles before applying a site&rsquo;s specific ones.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">*</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">margin</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">padding</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sets all element margins and paddings to 0 instead of a browser default.  Later rules can then apply specific margins and padding.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-selector">Attribute Selector</h3>
<p>The attribute selector is wrapped in square brackets (<code>[]</code>) and selects HTML elements with matching attribute values, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">[</span><span style="color:#f92672">readonly</span><span style="color:#f92672">]</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">gray</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will make any element with a <code>readonly</code> attribute have gray text.  The value can also be specified exactly, i.e.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">[</span><span style="color:#f92672">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;www.k-state.edu&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">]</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>or partially.  See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors#Syntax" target="_blank">MDN&rsquo;s documentation</a>
 for details.</p>
<h2 id="compound-selectors">Compound Selectors</h2>
<p>Simple selectors can be used in conjunction for greater specificity.  For example, <code>a.external-link</code> selects all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements with a class of <code>external-link</code>, and <code>input[type=checkbox]</code> selects all <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements with an attribute <code>type</code> set to <code>checkbox</code>.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-class">Pseudo-Class</h2>
<p>Pseudo-class selectors are proceeded with a single colon (<code>:</code>), and refer to the state of the element they modify.  Pseudo-classes must therefore be appended to a selector.</p>
<p>The most commonly used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which is applied to an element that the mouse is currently over.  Moving the mouse off the element will make this selector no longer apply. For example, <code>a:hover</code> applies only to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements with the mouse directly over them.</p>
<p>Another extremely useful pseudo-class is <code>:nth-child()</code>, which applies to the nth child (specify as an argument), i.e. <code>ul:nth-child(2)</code> will apply to the second child of any unordered list.  Additionally, <code>tr:nth-child(odd)</code> will apply to the odd-numbered rows of a table.</p>
<p>Additional pseudo-classes can be found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank">MDN documentation</a>
</p>
<h2 id="combinators">Combinators</h2>
<p>Combinators can be used to combine both simple and compound selectors using an operator.</p>
<h3 id="adjacent-sibling-combinator">Adjacent Sibling Combinator</h3>
<p>The plus symbol (<code>+</code>) can be used to select an adjacent sibling HTML element.  To be siblings, the first element must be followed by the second, and both must be children of a shared parent.  I.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">h1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-weight</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">bold</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will bold all paragraphs that directly follow a first-level header.</p>
<h3 id="general-sibling-combinator">General Sibling Combinator</h3>
<p>The tilde symbol (<code>~</code>) also selects a sibling, but they do not need to be adjacent, just children of the same parent.  The first element must still appear before the second (just not immediately after).</p>
<h3 id="child-combinator">Child Combinator</h3>
<p>The greater than symbol (<code>&gt;</code>) selects elements that are direct children of the first element.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">a</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-weight</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">bold</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will bold all anchor elements that are direct children of a paragraph element.</p>
<h3 id="descendant-combinator">Descendant Combinator</h3>
<p>A space (<code> </code>) selects elements that are descendants of the first element.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-selectors">Multiple Selectors</h2>
<p>Finally, we can apply the same rules to a collection of selectors by separating the selectors with commas, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">a</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> <span style="color:#f92672">p</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> <span style="color:#f92672">span</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-family</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Comic Sans&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">sans-serif</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Applies Comic Sans as the font for all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-elements">Pseudo-Elements</h2>
<p>An interesting newer development in CSS is the development of <em>psuedo-elements</em>, selectors that go beyond the elements included in the HTML of the page.  They are proceeded by <em>two</em> colons (<code>::</code>).  For example, the <code>::first-letter</code> selector allows you to change the first letter of a HTML element.  Thus:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span>:<span style="color:#a6e22e">first-child</span>::<span style="color:#a6e22e">first-letter</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-size</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">font-weight</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">bold</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">float</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">left</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>creates drop caps for all initial paragraphs.</p>
<p>A second use of pseudo-elements is to create new elements around existing ones with <code>::before</code> or <code>::after</code>.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">a</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">external-link</span>::<span style="color:#a6e22e">after</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">content</span>: url(<span style="color:#e6db74">external-link-icon.png</span>); 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Would add the <code>external-link-icon.png</code> image after any <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements with the <code>external-link</code> class.</p>

<h1 id="applying-css-rules">Applying CSS Rules</h1>

<p>There are multiple ways CSS rules can be applied to HTML elements.  A document containing CSS rules can be attached to a HTML document with a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, embedded directly into the html page with a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, or applied directly to a HTML element with the <code>style</code> attribute.  Let&rsquo;s look at each option.</p>
<h2 id="linked-css-documents">Linked CSS Documents</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> HTML element can be used to link the HTML page it appears in to a text file of CSS rules. These rules will then be applied to the HTML elements in the HTML document.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element should provide a hypertext reference attribute (<code>href</code>) providing a location for the linked document, and a relationship attribute (<code>rel</code>) describing the relationship between the HTML document and the stylesheet (hint: for a stylesheet the relationship is <code>&quot;stylesheet&quot;</code>).  If either of these attributes is missing or invalid, the stylesheet&rsquo;s rules will not be used.</p>
<p>For example, if the stylesheet is in the file styles.css, and our page is page.html, and both reside at the root of our website, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element would be:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href=&quot;/styles.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>By placing our CSS rules in a separate file and linking them to where they are used, we can minimize code duplication.  This approach also contributes to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">separation of concerns</a>
.  Thus, it is widely seen as a best practice for web development.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element should be declared within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="html-ltstylegt-element">HTML &lt;style&gt; Element</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> HTML element can be used to embed CSS rules directly in an HTML page.  Its content is the CSS rules to be applied.  The <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element must be a child of a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, though placing it into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is best practice.</p>
<p>To repeat our earlier efforts of making paragraphs have red text and green backgrounds with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">title</span>&gt;Style Element Example&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">title</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#f92672">p</span> { 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;red&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">background-color</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;green&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unlike the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element approach, CSS rules defined with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element can only be used with one file - the one in which they are embedded.  Thus, it can lead to code duplication.  And embedding CSS rules in an HTML document also breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">separation of concerns</a>
 design principle.</p>
<p>However, there are several use cases for which the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element is a good fit.  Most obvious is a HTML page that is being distributed as a file, rather than hosted on a server.  If the style information is embedded in that HTML file, the recipient only needs to receive the one file, rather than two.  Similarly, emails with HTML bodies typically use a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element to add styling to the email body.</p>
<h2 id="the-html-element-style-attribute">The HTML Element Style Attribute</h2>
<p>The <code>style</code> attribute of any HTML element can be used to apply CSS rules to that specific element. These rules are provided a string consisting of key/value pairs separated by semicolons. For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;This is a normal paragraph.&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">style</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;color: orange; font-weight: bold&#34;</span>&gt;But this one has inline styles applied to it.&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Produces this:</p>
<p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
<p style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">But this one has inline styles applied to it.</p>
<p>It should be clear from a casual glance that inline styles will make your code more difficult to maintain, as your styling rules will be scattered throughout a HTML document, instead of collected into a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element or housed in a separate CSS file.  And while inline styles can be used to selectively modify individual elements, CSS selectors (covered in the previous section) are typically a better approach.</p>
<p>Where inline styles make the most sense is when we manipulate the elements on the page directly using JavaScript.  Also, the browser developer tools let us manipulate inline styles directly, which can be helpful when tweaking a design.  Finally, some component-based design approaches (such as React) pivot the Separation of Concerns design principle to break a user interface into autonomous reusable components; in this approach content, style, and functionality are merged at the component level, making inline styles more appropriate.</p>

<h1 id="css-cascade">CSS Cascade</h1>

<p>Now that we know how to create an apply CSS rules to our HTML, let&rsquo;s explore how they actually are used.  A core idea behind CSS is the <strong>cascade algorithm</strong>, the <em>cascading</em> in <em>cascading style sheets (CSS)</em>.  The core idea behind the cascade algorithm is that as the browser encounters and parses CSS rules, they are collectively applied to the elements they match with.  If the same rule is set multiple times, say <code>color</code>, the cascading algorithm decides which should be applied.</p>
<h2 id="css-sources">CSS Sources</h2>
<p>Before we look at how cascades work, we need to understand the sources of CSS rules.  So far we&rsquo;ve focused on CSS rules created by the <em>author</em> - that is, the developer of the website.  But there are two other sources of CSS rules, the <em>user-agent</em> and the <em>user</em>.</p>
<h3 id="user-agent">User-Agent</h3>
<p>The term <strong>user-agent</strong> is the technical way of describing the browser (or other software) that is accessing the webpage.  Most browsers define default styles for their browser that help differentiate them from other browsers.  These default values work well for less-styled websites, but for a carefully designed user experience, an unexpected rule can wreak havoc.</p>
<p>For this reason, many websites use a special CSS file that overrides user-agent sheets to allow the website to start from a well-known state.  This is possible because rules appearing in sheets defined by the author override those defined in user-agent sheets.</p>
<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>The <strong>author</strong> is simply the creator of the webpage.  Thus, rules included with the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements, as well as in-line styles defined on the elements themselves with the <code>style</code> attribute, fall into this category.  Author styles always override user-agent styles, and are overridden in turn by user styles.</p>
<h3 id="user">User</h3>
<p>The <strong>user</strong> is the actual user of the browser, and they can add their own styles to an HTML document in a variety of ways.  One that you may encounter the most is adding custom styles with the web developer tools.  One that you may have not encountered, but is common in practice, are styles intended to make the website easier for the vision impaired to read and work with.  Increasing or decreasing text size with <code>[CTRL] + [+]</code> or <code>[CTRL] + [-]</code> is a simple example of this kind of tool.</p>
<h2 id="cascading-order">Cascading Order</h2>
<p>Thus, the general order of rules applied by the cascading algorithm is user-agent, author, user.  However, there is also the <code>!important</code> directive that can be added to CSS rules, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span> <span style="color:#75715e">!important</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which escalates them to a higher pass.  Also, CSS animations and transitions are evaluated at their own priority level.  Thus, we have a cascade order of:</p>
<table class="standard-table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
				<th scope="col">Origin</th>
				<th scope="col">Importance</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>user agent</td>
				<td>normal</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>user</td>
				<td>normal</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>author</td>
				<td>normal</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>animations</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>author</td>
				<td><code>!important</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>user</td>
				<td><code>!important</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>7</td>
				<td>user agent</td>
				<td><code>!important</code></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>8</td>
				<td>transitions</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

<h1 id="css-specificity">CSS Specificity</h1>

<p>But what about two rules that conflict that appear in the same level of the cascade order? For example, given the CSS:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">black</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">warning</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>what would the color of <code>&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;</code> be?  You might say it would be <code>red</code> because the <code>.warning</code> CSS rules come <em>after</em> the <code>p</code> rules.  And that would be true if the two rules had the same <em>specificity</em>.  An example of that is:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {<span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">black</span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {<span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Clearly the two selectors are equivalent, so the second <code>color</code> rule overrides the first.  But what if we go back to our first example, but flip the rules?</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">warning</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">black</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, the color is <em>still</em> <code>red</code>, because <code>.warning</code> is more <em>specific</em> than <code>p</code>.  This is the concept of <em>specificity</em> in CSS, which has an actual, calculable value.</p>
<h2 id="specificity-calculations">Specificity Calculations</h2>
<p>The specificity of a selector increases by the type and number of selectors involved.  In increasing value, these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type selectors and pseudo-elements</li>
<li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes</li>
<li>ID selectors</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these is trumped by in-line CSS rules, which can be thought of as the highest specificity.  Thus, we can think of specificity as a 4-element tuple (A, B, C, D):</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-6785d83e6c732a5f4f0d630e97042ec4" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.6.1.png" alt="Specificity Tuple" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-6785d83e6c732a5f4f0d630e97042ec4">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.6.1.png" alt="Specificity Tuple" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>We can then calculate the values of A,B,C,D:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count 1 if the declaration is from a ‘style’ attribute (inline style) rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= A).</li>
<li>Count the number of IDs in the selector (= B).</li>
<li>Count the number of Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= C).</li>
<li>Count the number of Element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= D).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-important-loophole">The !important Loophole</h2>
<p>Finally, there is an extra trick that we can use when we are having trouble creating enough specificity for a CSS rule.  We can add <code>!important</code> to the rule declaration.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">p</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">color</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">red</span> <span style="color:#75715e">!important</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>!important</code> rule overrides any other CSS declarations, effectively sidestepping specificity calculations.  It should be avoided whenever possible (by making good use of specificity), but there are occasions it might be necessary.</p>
<p>If multiple rules use <code>!important</code>, then their priority is again determined by specificity amongst the group.</p>

<h1 id="css-units">CSS Units</h1>

<p>When specifying CSS rules, you often need to provide a unit of measurement.  Any time you provide a measurement in a CSS rule, you must provide the units that measurement is being expressed in, following the value.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>#banner {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">width</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">300</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sets the width of the element with id <code>banner</code> to 300 pixels.</p>
<p>There are actually a lot of units available in CSS, and we&rsquo;ll summarize the most common in this section.</p>
<h2 id="units-of-absolute-size">Units of Absolute Size</h2>
<p>Absolute units don&rsquo;t change their size in relation to other settings, hence the name.  The most common one encountered is pixels, which are expressed with the abbreviation <code>px</code>.</p>
<p>Other absolute measurements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>q</code>, <code>mm</code>, <code>cm</code>, <code>in</code> which are quarter-millimeters, millimeters, centimeters, and inches.  These are rarely used outside of rules applied when printing websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pt</code>, <code>pc</code> which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_%28typography%29" target="_blank">points</a>
 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_%28typography%29" target="_blank">picas</a>
, common units of measurement within the publishing industry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="units-of-relative-size">Units of Relative Size</h2>
<p>Relative units are based on (relative to) the <code>font-size</code> property of the element, the viewport size, or grid container sizes. These are expressed as proportions of the units they are relative to, i.e.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">column</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">width</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">vw</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sets columns to be 30% of the width of the viewport.</p>
<h3 id="units-relative-to-font-size">Units Relative to Font Size</h3>
<p>Setting dimensions of borders, padding, and margins using units relative to font sizes can help make these appear consistent at different resolutions.  Consider a margin of <code>70px</code> - it might make sense on a screen 1024 pixels wide, but on a phone screen 300 pixels wide, nearly half the available space would be margins!</p>
<p>Units that are relative to the <code>font-size</code> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>em</code> one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_%28typography%29" target="_blank">em</a>
 is the font-size of the current element (which may be inherited from a parent).</li>
<li><code>rem</code> is same measurement as <code>em</code>, but disregards inherited font sizes.  Thus, it is more consistent with intent than <code>em</code>, and is largely displacing its use (though it is not supported in older versions of Internet Explorer).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="units-relative-to-viewport-size">Units Relative to Viewport Size</h3>
<p>The units <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> refer to 1/100th the height of the viewport (the size of the screen space the page can appear within).</p>
<p>It may be helpful to think of these as the percentage of the viewport width and viewport height, and they work much like percentages. However, in specifying heights, the <code>vh</code> will always set the height of an element, unlike <code>%</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fraction-units">Fraction Units</h3>
<p>The Grid model introduced the fraction (<code>fr</code>) unit, which is a fraction of the available space in a grid, after subtracting gutters and items sized in other units.  See the discussion of the CSS Grid Model or CSS Tricks&rsquo; <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">A Complete Guide to Grid</a>
 for more details.</p>
<h2 id="percentage-units">Percentage Units</h2>
<p>You can also specify percentages (<code>%</code>) for many properties, which are typically interpreted as a percentage of the parent element&rsquo;s width or height.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">column</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">width</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">%</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sets elements with the class <code>column</code> to be 33% the width of their parent element.  Similarly:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">row</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">height</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">%</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sets elements with a class <code>row</code> to be 20% the height of their parent element.</p>
<p>If the parent does not have an explicit width, the width of the next ancestor with a supplied width is used instead, and if no ancestor has a set width, that of the viewport is used.  The same is <em>almost</em> true of the height; however, if no elements have a specified height, then the percentage value is ignored - the element is sized according to its contents, as would be the case with <code>height: auto</code>.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>One of the most frustrating lessons beginning HTML authors must learn is the difference in how width and height are handled when laying out a webpage.  Using the percentage unit (<code>%</code>) to set the height almost never accomplishes the goal you have in mind - it only works if the containing element has a set height.</p>
<p>While there are hacky techniques that can help, they only offer partial solutions.  It is usually best not to fight the design of HTML, and adopt layouts that can flow down the page rather than have a height determined at render time.</p>

<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>#header {<span style="color:#66d9ef">height</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">150</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>#footer {<span style="color:#66d9ef">height</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>#content {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">height</span>: calc(<span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">vh</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">150</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here <code>100vh</code> is the height of the viewport, and the header and footer are defined in terms of pixels.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>You might want to apply the <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> on these elements if they have padding and borders, or these additional dimensions will need to be included in the calculation. See the section on the <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/4-css/11-css-box-model/" target="_blank">CSS Box Model</a>
 for more details.</p>

<h2 id="math-functions">Math Functions</h2>
<p>CSS provides a number of useful math functions:</p>
<h3 id="the-calc-function">The Calc Function</h3>
<p>As you have seen above, the <code>calc()</code> function can be used to calculate values by performing arithmetic upon values. These values can be in different units (i.e. <code>calc(200px - 5mm)</code> or even determined as the webpage is being interpreted (i.e. <code>calc(80vw + 5rem)</code>).  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for more details.</p>
<h3 id="the-min-and-max-functions">The Min and Max Functions</h3>
<p>CSS also provides <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> function, which provide the smallest or largest from the provided arguments (which can be arbitrary in number).  As with <code>calc()</code>, it can do so with interpretation-time values.</p>
<h3 id="the-clamp-function">The Clamp Function</h3>
<p>The <code>clamp()</code> function clamps a value within a provided range.  Its first argument is the minimum value, the second the preferred value, and the third the max.  If the preferred value is between the min and max value, it is returned.  If it is less than the minimum, the min is instead returned, or if it is greater than the maximum, the max value is returned.</p>
<h2 id="color-functions">Color Functions</h2>
<p>Several CSS functions are used to create an modify colors.  These are described in the CSS Color section.</p>
<h2 id="transformation-functions">Transformation Functions</h2>
<p>Many CSS functions exist for specifying CSS transforms. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform" target="_blank">MDN documentation</a>
 for details.</p>
<h2 id="image-filter-functions">Image Filter Functions</h2>
<p>CSS allows for filters to be applied to images.  More details can be found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter" target="_blank">Mozilla Documentation</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="counter-functions">Counter Functions</h2>
<p>Finally CSS uses counters to determine row number and ordered list numbers.  These can be manipulated and re-purposed in various ways. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for details.</p>

<h1 id="css-colors">CSS Colors</h1>

<p>CSS also has many properties that can be set to a color, i.e. <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>, <code>box-shadow</code>, etc. Colors consist of three or four values corresponding to the amount of red, green, and blue light blended to create the color. The optional fourth value is the alpha, and is typically used to specify transparency.</p>
<p>Colors are stored as 24-bit values, with 8 bits for each of the four channels (R,G,B,and A), representing 256 possible values (2^8) for each channel.</p>
<p>Colors can be specified in one of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Color Keywords</strong> like <code>red</code>, <code>dark-gray</code>, <code>chartreuse</code> correspond to well-defined values.  You can find the full list <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Color_keywords" target="_blank">in the MDN Documentation</a>
.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hexidecimal Values</strong> like <code>#6495ed</code>, which corresponds to cornflower blue.  The first two places represent the red component, the second the green, and the third the blue.  If an additional two places are provided the last pair represents the alpha component.  Each pair of hex values can represent 256 possible values (16^2), and is converted directly to the binary color representation in memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RGB Function</strong> a third option is to use the <code>RGB()</code> CSS function.  This take decimal arguments for each channel which should be in the range 0-255</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HSL Function</strong> a fourth option is the <code>HSL()</code> function, which specifies colors in terms of an alternative scheme of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Basic_principle" target="_blank">hue, saturation, and lightness</a>
.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RGBA and HSLA Functions</strong> finally, the <code>RGBA()</code> and <code>HSLA()</code> functions take the same arguments as their siblings, plus a value for the alpha channel between 0 and 1.  This alpha channel represents the opacity/transparency of the color, with 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque. Thus, a value of .75 represents 3/4 opacity, or 1/4 transparency.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="css-and-text">CSS and Text</h1>

<p>As the original purpose of the World-Wide-Web was to disseminate written information, it should be no surprise that CSS would provide many properties for working with text.  Some of the most commonly employed properties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>font-family</code> defines the font to use for the text.  Its value is one or more font family or generic font names, i.e. <code>font-family: Tahoma, serif</code>, <code>font-family: cursive</code> or <code>font-family: &quot;Comic Sans&quot;</code>.  Font family names are typically capitalized and, if they contain spaces or special characters, double-quoted.</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> determines the size of the font. It can be a measurement or a defined value like <code>x-small</code>.</li>
<li><code>font-style</code> determines if the font should use its <code>normal</code> (default), <code>italic</code>, or <code>oblique</code> face.</li>
<li><code>font-weight</code> determines the weight (boldness) of the font.  It can be <code>normal</code> or <code>bold</code> as well as <code>lighter</code> or <code>darker</code> than its parent, or specified as a numeric value between 1 and 1000.  Be aware that many fonts have a limited number of weights.</li>
<li><code>line-height</code> sets the height of the line box (the distance between lines of text).  It can be <code>normal</code>, or a numeric or percent value.</li>
<li><code>text-align</code> determines how text is aligned. Possible values are <code>left</code> (default), <code>center</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>justify</code>, along with some newer experimental values.</li>
<li><code>text-indent</code> indents the text by the specified value.</li>
<li><code>text-justify</code> is used in conjunction with <code>text-align: justify</code> and specifies how space should be distributed.  A value of <code>inter-word</code> distributes space between words (appropriate for English, Spanish, Arabic, etc), and <code>inter-character</code> between characters (appropriate for Japanese, Chinese, etc).</li>
<li><code>text-transform</code> can be used to capitalize or lowercase text. Values include <code>capitalize</code>, <code>uppercase</code>, and <code>lowercase</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-fonts">Choosing Fonts</h2>
<p>An important consideration when working with HTML text is that not all users will have the same fonts you have - and if the font is not on their system, the browser will fall back to a different option.  Specifying a generic font name after a Font Family can help steer that fallback choice; for example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>body {
  font-family: Lucinda, cursive
}</code></pre></div><p>will use Lucinda if available, or another cursive font if not.  Some guidelines on font choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cursive</code> fonts should typically only be used for headings, not body text.</li>
<li><code>serif</code> fonts (those with the additional feet at the base of letters) are easier to read printed on paper, but more difficult on-screen.</li>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> fonts are easier to read on-screen; your body text should most likely be a sans-serif.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-safe-fonts">Web-Safe Fonts</h3>
<p>Fonts that commonly appear across computing platforms and have a strong possibility of being on a users&rsquo; machine have come to be known as <em>web-safe</em>.  Some of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style='font-family: Arial'>Arial</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Helvetica'>Helvetica</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Times'>Times</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: "Courier New"'>Courier New</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Courier'>Courier</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Georgia'>Georgia</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: "Lucidia Console"'>Lucidia Console</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Palatino'>Palatino</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: Verdana'>Verdana</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="font-face-at-rule">Font-Face at Rule</h3>
<p>Alternatively, if you wish to use a less-common font, you can provide it to the browser using the <code>@font-face</code> rule. This defines a font and provides a source for the font file:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>@<span style="color:#66d9ef">font-face</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">font-family</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">examplefont</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">url</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;examplefont.ttf&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">);</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can then serve the font file from your webserver.</p>

<h1 id="css-box-model">CSS Box Model</h1>

<p>As the browser lays out HTML elements in a page, it uses the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong> to determine the size and space between elements.  The CSS box is composed of four nested areas (or outer edges): the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.</p>
<h2 id="box-areas">Box Areas</h2>
<p>
<a href="#image-eab50963cc601a6b315b1b666df65fff" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.11.1.png" alt="CSS Box Model" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-eab50963cc601a6b315b1b666df65fff">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.11.1.png" alt="CSS Box Model" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p><strong>Content Area</strong> contains the actual content of the element (the text, image, etc).  By default the CSS properties <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> set this size, and the <code>min-width</code>, <code>min-height</code>, <code>max-width</code>, <code>max-height</code> constrain it (but see the discussion of <code>box-sizing</code> below).</p>
<p><strong>Padding Area</strong> provides space between the content and the border of the HTML element.  It is set by the <code>padding</code> properties (<code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, <code>padding-bottom</code>, and <code>padding-left</code>, as well as the shorthand versions).</p>
<p><strong>Border Area</strong> draws a border around the element.  Its size is set with the <code>border-width</code> property.  Borders can also be dashed, inset, and given rounded corners. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border" target="_blank">MDN Border Documentation</a>
 for details.</p>
<p><strong>Margin Area</strong> provides the space between the border and neighboring elements.  Its size is set with the <code>margin</code> properties (<code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, and <code>margin-left</code>, as well as the shorthand versions).</p>
<h2 id="box-sizing">Box-Sizing</h2>
<p>By default, an element&rsquo;s <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties set the width and height of the <em>content area</em>, which means any padding, borders, and margins increase the size the element consumes on-screen.  This can be altered with the <code>box-sizing</code> CSS rule, which has the following possible values:</p>
<p><code>content-box</code> (the default) the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties set the content area&rsquo;s size.</p>
<p><code>border-box</code> includes the border area, padding area, and content area within the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the HTML element.  Using the CSS rule <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> therefore makes it easier to lay out elements on the page consistently, without having to do a lot of by-hand calculations.</p>
<h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>
<p>The <code>background</code> property allows you to set a color, pattern, or image as the background of an HTML element. By default the background extends to the border-area edge, but can be altered with the <code>border-clip</code> property to <code>border-box</code>, <code>padding-box</code>, or <code>content-box</code>.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background" target="_blank">MDN Background Documentation</a>
 for more details on creating backgrounds.</p>
<h2 id="box-shadow">Box-Shadow</h2>
<p>The <code>box-shadow</code> property allows you to set a drop shadow beneath the HTML element.  See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 for more details on creating box shadows.</p>

<h1 id="css-positioning">CSS Positioning</h1>

<p>By default HTML elements are positioned in the page using the HTML flow algorithm.  You can find a detailed discussion in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
.  However, you may want to override this and manually position elements, which you can do with the CSS properties <code>position</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-positioning-context">The Positioning Context</h2>
<p>First, we need to understand the positioning context, this is basically the area an element is positioned within.  The <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> properties affect where an element appears within its context.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-dbdf58fababe098b1aa12fa2a1fc336c" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.12.1.png" alt="Positioning Context" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-dbdf58fababe098b1aa12fa2a1fc336c">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/4.12.1.png" alt="Positioning Context" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>You can think of the context as a box.  The <code>left</code> property determines how far the element is from the left side of this context, the <code>top</code> from the top, <code>right</code> from the right, and <code>bottom</code> from the bottom. These values can be numeric or percentage values, and can be negative.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>If you define both a <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> value, only the <code>left</code> value will be used.  Similarly, if both <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> are supplied, only <code>top</code> is used.  Use the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties in conjunction with the positioning rules if you want to control the element&rsquo;s dimensions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What constitutes the positioning context depends on the elements <code>position</code> property, which we&rsquo;ll discuss next.</p>
<h2 id="the-position-property">The Position Property</h2>
<p>The <code>position</code> property can be one of several values:</p>
<h3 id="static-positioning">Static Positioning</h3>
<p>The default <code>position</code> value is <code>static</code>.  It positions the element where it would normally be in the flow and ignores any <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> properties.</p>
<h3 id="relative-positioning">Relative Positioning</h3>
<p>The <code>position</code> value of <code>relative</code> keeps the element where it would normally be in the flow, just like <code>static</code>.  However, the <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> properties move the element relative to this position - in effect, the positioning context is the hole the element would have filled with <code>static</code> positioning.</p>
<h3 id="absolute-positioning">Absolute Positioning</h3>
<p>Assigning the <code>position</code> property the value of <code>absolute</code> removes the element from the flow.  Other statically positioned elements will be laid out as though the absolutely positioned element was never there.  The positioning context for an absolutely positioned element is its first non-statically positioned ancestor, or (if there is none), the viewport.</p>
<p>A common CSS trick is to create a relatively-positioned element, and then absolutely position its children.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-positioning">Fixed Positioning</h3>
<p>Assigning the value of <code>fixed</code> to the <code>position</code> property also removes the element from the flow.  However, its positioning context is <em>always</em> the viewport.  Moreover, if the page is scrolled, a fixed-position element stays in the same spot (an absolutely-positioned element will scroll with the page). This makes fixed position elements useful for dialogs, pop-ups, and the like.</p>
<h2 id="z-order">Z-Order</h2>
<p>By default, elements are drawn in the browser in the order they appear in the HTML.  Thus, if we position an element further down the page, it may be covered up by succeeding elements.  The <code>z-index</code> property provides us with a fix. The default value for the <code>z-index</code> is 0.  Items with a larger <code>z-index</code> are drawn later.</p>

<h1 id="css-layouts">CSS Layouts</h1>

<p>We often speak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">separation of concerns</a>
 principle in the context of web development as setting up the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  In this understanding, HTML provides the organization of content, CSS provides for the presentation of the content, and JavaScript provides for user interaction.</p>
<p>In this understanding, CSS is often tasked with the role of laying out elements on the page.  More specifically, it overrides the default flow of HTML elements (see our earlier discussion of <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/3-html/04-flow-model/">block vs. inline elements</a>
 in the HTML chapter), altering how the browser arranges elements on the page.</p>
<p>The three most common layout approaches currently used in modern web development are <em>float</em>, <em>flexbox</em>, and <em>grid</em>, named for the CSS properties that make them possible.  You may also encounter <em>absolutely positioned</em> layouts and <em>table layouts</em>, so we will briefly discuss those as well.</p>
<h2 id="float-layouts">Float Layouts</h2>
<p>By default a block-level element stretches the width of the parent element, and its siblings are pushed underneath.  The CSS <code>float</code> property changes this behavior, allowing a block-level element to determine an appropriate width based on its content (or CSS rules), and allows sibling elements to &ldquo;float&rdquo; next to it.  Thus, the <code>float</code> property has two primary values, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> (as well as <code>none</code> and <code>inherit</code>).  A <code>float: left</code> causes the element to float on the left side of its containing element, and a <code>float: right</code> floats it to the right.</p>
<p>A common use is to float figures and images within a page, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">blockquote</span>&gt;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;People tend to think of the web as a way to get information or perhaps as a place  to carry out ecommerce. But really, the web is about accessing applications. Think of each website as an application, and every single click, every single interaction with that site, is an opportunity to be on the very latest version of that application.&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;

But floats can also be used to create multi-column layouts, i.e.:

<p>Finally, when discussing the <code>float</code> property, we need to discuss the <code>clear</code> property as well.  The <code>clear</code> property is used to move an element below the margin area of any floating elements - basically resetting the flow of the page.  It can selectively clear floating elements in the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>both</code> directions.  In our column example, if we wanted to add a footer that stretched across all three columns, we&rsquo;d use something like:</p>

<h2 id="flexbox-layouts">Flexbox Layouts</h2>
<p>The Flexible Box Layout (flexbox) is intended to offer a greater degree of control and <em>flexibility</em> (pun intended) to laying out web pages.  Its purpose is to provide an efficient way of laying out, aligning, and distributing elements within a container.  Moreover, it can carry out this goal even when the sizes of the child elements are unknown or dynamic.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-3be5a5d7a5d2b30f222e0cb284539ad7" class="lightbox-link">

</a></p>
<p>The flexbox model therefore consists of two levels of nested elements - an outer <em>container</em> element and inner content <em>item</em> elements (the content item elements themselves can have many descendant elements).  The flexbox properties help define how the content item elements are laid out within their parent container.</p>
<p>An HTML element is turned into a flexbox container by assigning it the <code>display</code> property of <code>flex</code>.  Additional properties then control how the elements contained within our new flexbox container are laid out.  These include:</p>
<p><code>flex-direction</code> determines how items are laid out, either <code>row</code>, <code>column</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, or <code>column-reverse</code>.</p>
<p><code>wrap-items</code> determines if the row or column wraps into multiple rows or columns.  Its values are <code>no-wrap</code> (default), <code>wrap</code>, and <code>wrap-reverse</code>.</p>
<p><code>justify-content</code> defines how content items will be aligned along the main axis of the container (horizontal for rows, and vertical for columns).  Its possible values are: <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>.</p>
<p><code>align-items</code> defines how content items are aligned along the secondary axis of the container (vertically for rows, and horizontally for columns).  Its possible values are <code>flex-start</code> (the default), <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code>, and <code>baseline</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, to re-create our three-column layout with flexbox, we would:</p>

<p>The items can also override these default behaviors with item specific CSS attributes, including allowing items to grow with <code>flex-grow</code> or shrink with <code>flex-shrink</code> to fit available space, override the default order of elements using the <code>order</code> attribute, or altering the alignment on a per-item basis with <code>align-self</code>.</p>
<p>You can also create very sophisticated layouts by nesting flex containers within flex containers.  A superb reference for working with flexbox is CSS Tricks&rsquo; <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Complete Guide to Flexbox</a>

<h2 id="grid-layouts">Grid Layouts</h2>
<p>While flexbox brought a lot of power to the web designer, the Grid model is an even more powerful way to lay out web elements.  Unlike flex, which focuses on arranging elements along one dimension (provided you aren&rsquo;t wrapping), the Grid model lays elements out in a two-dimensional grid.</p>
<p>An HTML element is turned into a grid container by assigning it the <code>display</code> property of <code>grid</code> or <code>inline-grid</code>.  Then you define the size of the grid elements with the properties <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code>.  These attributes take the measurements of the columns and rows.  I.e. we could recreate our three-column layout with <code>grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%</code>.  But the grid is far more powerful than that.  Let&rsquo;s expand our three-column layout to have a separate header and footer:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#page {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">display</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">grid</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">grid-template-columns</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>fr <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>fr <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>fr;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">grid-template-rows</span>:  <span style="color:#ae81ff">150</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">auto</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we use the unit <code>fr</code> for our column width, which proportions out the &ldquo;free space remaining&rdquo; after hard-coded measurements are accounted for.  In our case, this translates into three equal-sized columns taking up all the available space.</p>
<p>For rows, our first row will be the header, and we&rsquo;ve sized it to 150 pixels.  The next row is our content, we&rsquo;ve used the <code>auto</code> value to allow it to size appropriately to contain its content.  The last row is the footer, and we&rsquo;ve sized it to 100 pixels.</p>
<p>Our HTML would look like:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;page&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;one&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;two&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">footer</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And finally, we can assign these HTML elements to part of the grid with the <code>grid-area</code> property, which takes the values for <em>row start</em>, <em>column start</em>, <em>row end</em>, <em>column end</em> separated by slashes (<code>/</code>) to define the area of the grid they span:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve really only scratch the surface of what is possible with the grid. Items can be aligned and justified, and tweaked in other ways, just as with flexbox. Names can be assigned to grid rows, grid columns, and grid areas, and used to make the resulting CSS more approachable and understandable.</p>

<h2 id="table-layouts">Table Layouts</h2>
<p>At one point in the 1990&rsquo;s, it was common practice for graphic designers to create  a web page using graphic design software, export it as an image, and then slice up the image.  These pieces were then used as the <code>background-image</code> property of a table cell, and text was overlaid on this graphics as the contents of the cell.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this practice has largely been abandoned, but you may still encounter it from time to time.  There are some very real problems with the approach: if you increase the text size on the page, the cells may expand beyond the size of their background image, and the seams between the images will open up.  Also, if a screen reader is used, it will often read content out-of-order and will describe the portions in terms of table rows and columns.</p>
<p>In web design best practices, tables should only be used for tabular data.  If you desire to use this kind of slice-and-dice approach, use the Grid instead.  It provides the same control over the placement of text, and can use a single <code>background-image</code> on the container element or multiple background images for the items.</p>

<h1 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h1>

<p>Modern websites are displayed on a wide variety of devices, with screen sizes from 640x480 pixels (VGA resolution) to 3840x2160 pixels (4K resolution). It should be obvious therefore that one-size-fits-all approach to laying out web applications does not work well.  Instead, the current best practice is a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a>
.  When using this strategy your web app should automatically adjusts the layout of the page based on how large the device screen it is rendered on.</p>
<h2 id="media-queries">Media Queries</h2>
<p>At the heart of the responsive CSS approach is a CSS technique called <em>media queries</em>.  These are implemented with a CSS media at-rule (at-rules modify the behavior of CSS, and are proceeded by an at symbol (<code>@</code>), hence the name).  The original purpose of the media rule was to define different media types - i.e. <code>screen</code> and <code>print</code>, which would be selectively applied based on the media in play.  For example, the rule:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>@<span style="color:#66d9ef">media</span> <span style="color:#f92672">print</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">img</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">display</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">none</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .<span style="color:#a6e22e">advertisement</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">display</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">none</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>would hide all images and elements with the <code>advertisement</code> class when printing a web page.  You can also specify the media type with the <code>media</code> attribute in a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, i.e. <code>&lt;link href=&quot;print.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;print&quot;&gt;</code> would apply the rules from <code>print.css</code> only when printing the website.</p>
<p>However, the real usefulness of the <code>@media</code> rule is when it is combined with a <em>media query</em>, which determines if its nested rules should be applied based on some aspect of the display.</p>
<p>The media query consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>@media</code> keyword</li>
<li>An optional media type (typically <code>screen</code>, but could also be <code>all</code>, <code>print</code>, and <code>speech</code>)</li>
<li>The desired media features surrounded by parentheses.  Multiple features can be joined by logical operators <code>and</code>, or logically or-ed using a <code>,</code>.  More advanced queries can use <code>not</code> to invert an expression (if using <code>not</code> you <em>must</em> specify the media type).</li>
<li>A block of CSS surrounded by <code>{}</code></li>
</ol>
<p>An example media query that applies only when the screen is in portrait orientation (taller than it is wide) is:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>@<span style="color:#66d9ef">media</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">orientation</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">portrait</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">/* rules for a portrait orientation go here... */</span> 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The most commonly used media features are <code>max-width</code>, <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-height</code>, <code>min-height</code>, and <code>orientation</code>. The sizes can be specified in any CSS unit of measurement, but typically <code>px</code> is used.  The <code>orientation</code> can either be <code>portrait</code> or <code>landscape</code>.</p>
<p>We can also combine multiple queries into a single <code>@media</code> rule:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span>@<span style="color:#66d9ef">media</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">orientation</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">landscape</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">max-width</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">700px</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">/* rules for a landscape-oriented screen 700 pixels or less wide */</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>and</code> in this case works like a logical <code>and</code>.  You can also use the <code>not</code> keyword, which inverts the meaning of the query, or commas <code>,</code>, which operate like a logical <code>or</code>.</p>
<p>More details on the use of media queries can be found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 on the subject.</p>
<p>By combining the use of media queries, and CSS layout techniques, you can drastically alter the presentation of a web application for different devices.  Most browser development tools will also let you preview the effect of these rules by selecting a specific device size and orientation.  See the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/" target="_blank">Chrome Device Mode</a>
 documentation, Safari <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/" target="_blank">Developer Documentation</a>
, and Firefox <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode" target="_blank">Responsive Design Mode Documentation</a>
 for details.</p>
<h2 id="the-viewport-meta-tag">The Viewport Meta Tag</h2>
<p>The media query size features relate to the <em>viewport</em>, a rectangle representing the browser&rsquo;s visible area.  For a desktop browser, this is usually equivalent to the <em>client area</em> of the browser window (the area of the window excluding the borders and menu bar).  For mobile devices, however, the viewport is often much bigger than the actual screen size, and then scaled to fit on the screen:</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-d036a62b5e055621cc2725d1265990fd" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/1.5.1.jpg" alt="The mobile viewport scaling strategy" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">
</a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-d036a62b5e055621cc2725d1265990fd">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/1.5.1.jpg" alt="The mobile viewport scaling strategy" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>This strategy helps legacy websites reasonably appear on mobile devices.  However, with responsive designs, we want the viewport and the device size to match exactly.  We can clue mobile browsers into this desire by adding a specific meta tag to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">meta</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;viewport&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">content</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&#34;</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For a responsive design to work, it is critical that this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element be included, and use the exact syntax specified.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-css-layouts">Advanced CSS Layouts</h2>
<p>Finally, responsive designs tend to make heavy use of two new CSS layout strategies - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" target="_blank">The Flexible Box Module (flex)</a>
 and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout</a>
.  These two layout tools allow for easily changing layouts within media queries - even allowing for the rearranging of elements!</p>

<h1 id="css-transformations">CSS Transformations</h1>

<p>With powerful graphics cards becoming commonplace, the W3C standards expanded the CSS rules to take advantage of their abilities. Specifically, the CSS <code>transform</code> property allows us to apply a transformation (scaling, rotating, translating, stretching, skewing, or any combination) to elements on a page. These are performed using a mathematical operation based on the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29" target="_blank">matrices</a>
. Graphics cards are optimized to perform these matrix operations in parallel, allowing them to quickly transform graphical objects in 3-dimensional space. While a full discussion of the underlying mathematical operations is outside the scope of this course, we don&rsquo;t have to create the matrices ourselves - the CSS rules provide function for building and combining the most common transformation matrices.</p>
<p>To explore these transformations, we will use a demonstration <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and css rules:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Transformed&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">transform-example</span> {

<div class="transform-example">Element to be Transformed</div>
<h3 id="coordinate-space">Coordinate Space</h3>
<p>An important concept to grasp before tackling transformations is the concept of coordinate spaces.  A coordinate space is simply a way of expressing position, relative to an origin point.  You have likely studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" target="_blank">Cartesian coordinate system</a>
 in your math courses. CSS uses a similar approach for applying transforms in 2d or 3d space, with one important difference - the <strong>y-axis is reversed</strong>.  Thus, the 2d coordinate system looks like:</p>
<h3 id="translation">Translation</h3>
<p>The first transformation we&rsquo;ll discuss is <em>translation</em>, moving an element along the x, y, or z axes. In most cases, we&rsquo;re focused on just the x and y coordinates, for which we can use the <code>translate(x, y)</code> function:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;translation-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Translated&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#translation-example {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">transform</span>: translate(<span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">-30</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">px</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="transform-example" id="translation-example">Element to be Translated</div>
<style>
div#translation-example {
  transform: translate(100px, -30px);
}
</style>
<p>We can also translate in three dimensions with the <code>translate3d()</code> function, but note that visually a change in the z position will not be visually apparent in most cases (unless we are using a perspective transformation). Additionally, we can create a translation matrix with only the x, y, or z axis using <code>translateX(x)</code>, <code>translateY(y)</code>, and <code>translateZ(z)</code>, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>Rotation can happen around any of the primary axes, facilitated by the <code>rotateX(angle)</code>, <code>rotateY(angle)</code>, and <code>rotateZ(angle)</code>. Rotation angles can be expressed in degrees (<code>deg</code>) or radians (<code>rad</code>).  Rotation about the z is perhaps the most commonly used, as it &ldquo;spins&rdquo; an element on the page:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;rotation-z-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Rotated&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#rotation-z-example {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">transform</span>: rotateZ(<span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">deg</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="transform-example" id="rotation-z-example">Element to be Rotated</div>
<style>
div#rotation-z-example {
  transform: rotateZ(45deg);
}
</style>
<p>But rotations about the x or y can also be interesting, as they rotate <em>around</em> the screen, but to avoid looking like a squished version of the untransformed element, should be combined with a perspective transform.  We&rsquo;ll revisit this after discussing combining transformations.</p>
<h3 id="scale">Scale</h3>
<p>Scaling refers to increasing or decreasing the size of the element, either all together or along a single axis. We can use the <code>scale(x, y)</code> to scale in two dimensions, <code>scale(x, y, z)</code> to scale in three, or <code>scaleX(x)</code>, <code>scaleY(y)</code>, or <code>scaleZ(z)</code> to scale along a single axis. Scale values are expressed as floating point numbers (1 = 100%, 1.5 = 150%, -0.5 = -50%).</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;scale-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Scaled&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#scale-example {

<style>
div#scale-example {
  transform: scale(0.5, 0.5);
}
</style>
<h3 id="skew">Skew</h3>
<p>Skewing distorts an element, distorting each point in the element by a certain angle in the horizontal, vertical, or both (CSS skew functions are only expressed in two dimensions). You can use <code>skew(xAngle, yAngle)</code> to specify both vertical and horizontal, or <code>skewX(angle)</code> and <code>skewY(angle)</code> to do skew separately.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;skew-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Skewed&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#skew-example {

<style>
div#skew-example {
  transform: skewX(-10deg);
}
</style>
<h3 id="combining-transformations">Combining Transformations</h3>
<p>To combine multiple transformations, just list the transformation function one after another. For example, to translate and rotate we could:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;transform-example&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;combo-example&#34;</span>&gt;Element to be Transformed&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">div</span>#combo-example {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">transform</span>: translateX(<span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">%</span>) rotateZ(<span style="color:#ae81ff">60</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">deg</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="transform-example" id="combo-example">Element to be Transformed</div>
<style>
div#combo-example {
  transform: translateX(200px) rotateZ(60deg);
}
</style>
<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>
<p>When using three dimensions, it is helpful to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection" target="_blank">perspective projection</a>
.  This is a mathematical transformation that makes points far from the viewer appear closer to one another than those closer to the viewer.  This mimics how our eyes and brain interpret what we see in the world as depth.</p>
<p>The perspective projection is specified with the <code>projection(distance)</code> function, where the distance is how far you are from the element being transformed along the z-axis. In general, a small number will create a more dramatic transformation than a large one.</p>

<h1 id="css-transitions">CSS Transitions</h1>

<p>While most CSS rules are applied as the page is loaded, some are applied at a future point.  One example is pseudo-classes that apply in limited circumstances - like <code>:hover</code> which applies only when the mouse is over an element, or <code>:valid</code> and <code>:invalid</code> which are applied to input elements based on their validation status. Another common instance is when elements are added to the page using JavaScript, as discussed in <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/">Chapter 5 - JavaScript</a>
.</p>
<p>In these instances, we may want the change in styling rules to not apply instantly, but rather transition between states over a short duration. The <code>transition</code> property provides us this functionality.  It has three sub-properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>transition-property</code> - the property or properties to transition. This can include any of the CSS properties that are defined as being animatible (basically those that have continuous values).</li>
<li><code>transition-duration</code> - how long the transition should take, expressed in seconds or milliseconds.</li>
<li><code>transition-timing-function</code> - one of several timing functions that define how the value transitions over time</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also express all three with the shorthand `transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function].</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see an example:</p>

<p>We can combine multiple transitions by providing a comma-separated list to the <code>transition</code> shorthand property:</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can define multiple transitions with the sub-properties.  In this case, the <code>transition-property</code> is a comma-separated list, and the <em>same</em> <code>transition-duration</code> and <code>transition-timing-function</code> apply to all specified properties:</p>

<h1 id="css-timing-functions">CSS Timing Functions</h1>

<p>The <code>transition</code> property (and the animations we&rsquo;ll look at shortly) both make use of timing functions - functions that define how the values of a CSS property change over time as we transition from one state to the next.</p>
<p>The simplest (and default) transition function is <em>linear</em>, which means the value smoothly transitions from its starting value to its ending value. It is specified as <code>linear</code>.</p>
<p>While linear is easy to reason about and represent mathematically, transitions often look more realistic if the start or end more slowly, speeding up in the middle. Graphically, these functions look like a curve, and can be mathematically represented by a Bezier curve.  We can specify this curve with <code>cubic-bezier(&lt;x1&gt;, &lt;y1&gt;, &lt;x2&gt;, &lt;y2&gt;)</code> where the arguments are the coordinates of control points.</p>
<p>But for ease of use (and so we don&rsquo;t need to learn the math behind Bezier curves), CSS also provides several pre-defined Bezier curves we can use instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ease</code> - starts and ends slowly, with a rapid speeding up in the middle</li>
<li><code>ease-in</code> - starts slowly, speeds up, and stops suddenly</li>
<li><code>ease-out</code> - starts quickly but slows down at the end</li>
<li><code>ease-in-out</code> - similar to <code>ease</code>, but the start and end transitions are more even</li>
</ul>
<p>The transition timing functions we&rsquo;ve just discussed are the most commonly employed in web design.  But there are other transitions functions available in the CSS standards, and if you understand the mathematics behind Bezier curves, you can define your own as well.  You can read more about the subject in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
.</p>

<h1 id="css-animation">CSS Animation</h1>

<p>As the web became more interactive, there was an increased desire to animate elements on webpages. Animations are a powerful tool for increasing visual interest and also conveying information.  Consider the Apple sign-in dialog, which on an incorrect username/password combination shakes back and forth briefly, mimicking a human&rsquo;s head shaking.</p>
<p>Early animations in the web relied on using JavaScript to change properties of elements on the page. While these techniques are still used, they are increasingly supplanted by new CSS rules that are easier to write and provide more precise control.</p>

<h1 id="css-libraries">CSS Libraries</h1>

<p>While you can write custom CSS to accomplish nearly any look you want for your webpages, many developers prefer to use a pre-written CSS library that provides rules covering many common user interface needs.  For example, CSS-based menus are very challenging to write well, but a well-designed library makes the task very approachable.  CSS libraries also provide a consistent UI look and feel across websites, which helps people browsing your website quickly identify how to move around.</p>
<p>One of the most popular CSS frameworks is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
, which is used by thousands of websites.  Other popular CSS libraries include <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>
, <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic</a>
, and <a href="https://animate.style/" target="_blank">Animate</a>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>As the World Wide Web was gaining popularity in the mid-nineties, browser manufacturers started experimenting with interpreting program scripts embedded within webpages.  By far the most successful of these was JavaScript, initially developed by Brandon Eich for Netscape.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-fd89e872a3ad75e10d09b0045d2fddd0" class="lightbox-link">

<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/Brendan_Eich.jpg" alt="Brandon Eich" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>Brandon Eich was hired to integrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Scheme programming language</a>
 into the Netscape browser.  But when Netscape cut a deal with Sun Microsystems to bring Java Applets to their browser, his mission was altered to create a more Java-like language.  He developed a prototype in only ten days, that blended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Java</a>
 syntax, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Self</a>
 object-orientation approach, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Scheme</a>
 functionality.</p>
<p>Netscape eventually submitted JavaScript to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>
, resulting in the ECMAScript standard, and opening the door for other browsers to adopt JavaScript.  Currently all major browsers support the full ECMAScript 5 standard, and large chunks of ECMAScript 6 and some parts of later versions as well. Moreover, <em>transpilation</em> can be utilized to make newer ECMAScript-compliant code run on older browser versions.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">

<p>The ECMA standard is maintained by <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>
, not the W3C.  However, its development process is very similar, involving stakeholders developing proposals for new and improved features.</p>

</script>
<p>Because Netscape was adopting Java at the same time they were developing what would become JavaScript, there was a push to make the syntax stay somewhat consistent between the two languages.  As a result, JavaScript has much of the look and feel of an imperative language like C, C#, or Java.</p>
<p>However, this similarity can be deceptive, because how JavaScript operates can be quite different than those languages.  This can lead to frustration for imperative programmers learning JavaScript.  As we go over the basics of the language, I will strive to call out these tricky differences.</p>
<p>To assist you in learning JavaScript syntax, we&rsquo;ve added an interactive console to this textbook where you can type in arbitrary JavaScript code and see the result of its execution, much like the console that Developer Tools provide.  You can click the word &ldquo;Console&rdquo; on the purple tab below to expand it, and click it again to minimize it.</p>

<p>JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means instead of being compiled into machine code, it is interpreted by a special program - an interpreter.  Each browser has its own interpreter implementation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a traditional example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello world&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Copy/paste or type this code into the console provided at the bottom of the page. What is the output?</p>
<p>As you might expect, this prints the string &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; to standard output.  Notice we didn&rsquo;t need to put this code into a <code>main</code> function - JavaScript code is executed as it is encountered by the interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="terminating-lines-of-code">Terminating Lines of Code</h2>
<p>Also, the semicolon is an optional way to end an expression.  A new line is other way to do so, so these two programs:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;World&#34;</span>)</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>);<span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;World&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>are equivalent.  We can also use both a semicolon and a new line (as in the first example).  A common technique for making JavaScript files smaller, known as <em>minifying</em> takes advantage of this fact to write an entire program in a single line!  We&rsquo;ll discuss how and when to do so later.</p>
<h2 id="data-types">Data Types</h2>
<p>Like any programming language, JavaScript has a number of predefined data types.  We can also query the data type of a value at runtime, using the <code>typeof</code> keyword.  Try typing some of these lines into the console:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.3</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>Numbers include integers and floats, though JavaScript mostly uses the distinction for how a value is stored in memory and presents the programmer with the <code>number</code> type.  This category also includes some special values, like <code>NaN</code> (not a number) and <code>Infinity</code>.   We can perform all the standard arithmetic operations on any number (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>).<br>
These operations are also &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the sense that they will not throw an error. For example, try typing <code>4/0</code> in the terminal below.  The value you see as a result is still a number!</p>
<p>The JavaScript interpreter will switch between an integer and float representation internally as it makes sense to.  For example, type <code>4.0</code> and you&rsquo;ll see the console echoes <code>4</code> to you, showing it is storing the number as an integer.  Try typing <code>4.1</code>, and you&rsquo;ll see it stores it as a float.</p>
<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
<p>The <code>string</code> type in JavaScript can be declared literally using single (<code>'</code>) or double (<code>&quot;</code>) quotes, and as of ES6, tick marks (<code>`</code>).</p>
<p>Double and single-quoted strings work exactly the same. They must be on the same line, though you can add newline characters to both using <code>\n</code>.  The backslash is used as an escape character, so to include it in a string you must use a double-backslash instead <code>\\</code>.  Finally, in a single-quoted string you can escape a single quote, i.e. <code>'Bob\'s Diner'</code>, and similarly for double-quotes: <code>&quot;\&quot;That's funny,\&quot; she said.&quot;</code>  Judicious choices of single-or double-quoted strings can avoid much of this complication.</p>
<p>You can also directly reference unicode characters with <code>\u[ref number]</code>.  Try typing the sequence <code>&quot;\u1F63C&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, strings enclosed with tick marks (<code>`</code>) are <em>template literals</em> that have a few special properties.  First, they can span multiple lines, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">`This is a 
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">multiline string
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">example`</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The line breaks will be interpreted as new line characters.  Secondly, you can embed arbitrary JavaScript inside of them using <code>${}</code>.  Give it a try:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">`The sum of 2 and 3 is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>In JavaScript there is no character type.  In practice, the role characters normally play in programs is filled by strings of length one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>
<p>JavaScript also has the boolean literals <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.  It also implements the boolean logical operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (logical and) <code>||</code> (logical or), and <code>!</code> (logical not).</p>
<h3 id="undefined">Undefined</h3>
<p>JavaScript has a special value <code>undefined</code> that means a value hasn&rsquo;t been set.  You probably saw it when you entered the <code>console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</code> example above, which spit out:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt;  Hello World!
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;· undefined</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As the console echoes the value of the prior line, it was printing the return value of <code>console.log()</code>.  Since <code>console.log()</code> doesn&rsquo;t return a value, this results in <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<h3 id="null">Null</h3>
<p>JavaScript also defines a <code>null</code> type, even though <code>undefined</code> fills many of the roles <code>null</code> fills in other languages.  However, the programmer must explicitly supply a <code>null</code> value.  So if a variable is <code>null</code>, you know it was done <em>intentionally</em>, if it is <code>undefined</code>, it may be that it was accidentally not initialized.</p>
<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
<p>The <code>object</code> type is used to store more than one value, and functions much like a dictionary in other languages.  Objects can be declared literally with curly braces, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">first</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Jim&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">last</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hawkins&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">age</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">16</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>An object is essentially a collection of key/value pairs, known as <strong>properties</strong>.  We&rsquo;ll discuss objects in more depth in the <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/05-objects-and-classes/">Objects and Classes</a>
 section.</p>
<h3 id="symbols">Symbols</h3>
<p>Finally, the <code>symbol</code> type is a kind of identifier.  We&rsquo;ll discuss it more later.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript uses <em>dynamic typing</em>.  This means the type of a variable is not declared in source code, rather it is determined at runtime.  Thus, all variables in JavaScript are declared with the <code>var</code> keyword, regardless of type:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;A string&#34;</span>;  <span style="color:#75715e">// A string
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">b</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>;           <span style="color:#75715e">// A number
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>;        <span style="color:#75715e">// A boolean
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition, the type of a variable can be changed at any point in the code, i.e. the statements:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;A string&#34;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>; 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>is perfectly legal and workable.  The type of <code>a</code>, changes from a string to a float when its value is changed.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>var</code> keyword, constants are declared with <code>const</code>.  Constants must have a value assigned with their declaration and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Finally, ECMA6 introduced the <code>let</code> keyword, which operates similar to <code>var</code> but is locally scoped (see the discussion of functional scope for details).</p>
<h2 id="type-conversions">Type Conversions</h2>
<p>JavaScript does its best to use the specified variable, which may result in a type conversion.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will result in the string <code>'foo3'</code>, as the <code>+</code> operator means concatenation for strings. However, <code>/</code> has no override for strings, so</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will result in <code>NaN</code> (not a number).</p>
<p>Additionally, when you attempt to use a different data type as a boolean, JavaScript will interpret its &rsquo;truthiness&rsquo;.  The values <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and <code>0</code> are considered <code>false</code>.  All other values will be interpreted as <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="control-structures">Control Structures</h2>
<p>JavaScript implements many of the familiar control structures of conditionals and loops.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Be aware that variables declared within a block of code using <code>var</code> are subject to function scope, and exist outside of the conditional branch/loop body.  This can lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="if-else-statements">If Else Statements</h3>
<p>The JavaScript <code>if</code> and <code>if else</code> statements look just like their Java counterparts:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">logical</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">test</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>As do <code>while</code> and <code>do while</code> loops:</p>

<p>While JavaScript may look like an imperative language on the surface, much of how it behaves is based on <em>functional</em> languages like Scheme.  This leads to some of the common sources of confusion for programmers new to the language.  Let&rsquo;s explore just what its functional roots mean.</p>
<p>JavaScript implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function" target="_blank">first-class functions</a>
, which means they can be assigned to a variable, passed as function arguments, returned from other functions, and even nested inside other functions.  Most of these uses are not possible in a traditional imperative language, though C# and Java have been adding more functional-type behavior.</p>
<h2 id="defining-functions">Defining Functions</h2>
<p>Functions in JavaScript are traditionally declared using the <code>function</code> keyword, followed by an identifier, followed by parenthesized arguments, and a body enclosed in curly braces, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">doSomething</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arg1</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg2</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg3</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// Do something here...
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, the name can be omitted, resulting in an <em>anonymous</em> function:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">arg1</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg2</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg3</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// Do something here...
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally ES6 introduced the arrow function syntax, a more compact way of writing anonymous functions, similar to the lambda syntax of C#:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arg1</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg2</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">arg3</span>) =&gt; {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// Do something here...
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, arrow function syntax also has special implications for scope, which we will discuss shortly.</p>
<h2 id="invoking-functions">Invoking Functions</h2>
<p>Functions are invoked with a parenthetical set of arguments, i.e.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`Hello, </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Go ahead and define this function by typing the definition into your console.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done so, it can be invoked with <code>sayHello(&quot;Bob&quot;)</code>, and would print <code>Hello, Bob</code> to the console.  Give it a try:</p>
<iframe src="https://jsconsole.com/" style="width:100%"></iframe>
<p>Functions can also be invoked using two methods defined for all functions, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call" target="_blank">call()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply" target="_blank">apply()</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="function-arguments">Function Arguments</h2>
<p>One of the bigger differences between JavaScript and imperative languages is in how JavaScript handles arguments.  Consider the <code>hello()</code> function we defined above. What happens if we invoke it with no arguments?  Or if we invoke it with two arguments?</p>
<p>Give it a try:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Mary&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Bob&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What are we seeing here?  In JavaScript, the number of arguments supplied to a function when it is invoked is <em>irrelevant</em>.  The same function will be invoked regardless of the <em>arity</em> (number) or <em>type</em> of arguments.  The supplied arguments will be assigned to the defined argument names within the function&rsquo;s scope, according to the order. If there are less supplied arguments than defined ones, the missing ones are assigned the value <code>undefined</code>.  And if there are extra arguments supplied, they are not assigned to a value.</p>
<p>Can we access those extra arguments?  Yes, because JavaScript places them in a variable <code>arguments</code> accessible within the function body.  Let&rsquo;s modify our <code>sayHello()</code> method to take advantage of this knowledge, using the <code>for .. of</code> loop we saw in the last section:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">of</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arguments</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`Hello, </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And try invoking it with an arbtrary number of names:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Mike&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Mary&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Bob&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Sue&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>JavaScript does not have a mechanism for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading" target="_blank">function overloading</a>
 like C# and Java do. In JavaScript, if you declare a second &ldquo;version&rdquo; of a function that has different named arguments, you are not creating an overloaded version - you&rsquo;re replacing the original function!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, when we entered our second <code>sayHello()</code> definition in the console, we overwrote the original one.  Each function name will <em>only</em> reference a single definition at a time within a single scope, and just like with variables, we can change its value at any point.</p>
<p>Finally, because JavaScript has first-order functions, we can pass a function as an argument.  For example, we could create a new function, <code>greet()</code> that takes the greeter&rsquo;s name, a function to use to greet others, and uses the arguments to greet an arbitrary number of people:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">greet</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">greetingFn</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arguments</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">length</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span><span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">greetingFn</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arguments</span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span>]);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`It&#39;s good to meet you.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can then use it by passing our <code>sayHello()</code> function as the second argument:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">greet</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Mark&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">sayHello</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Joe&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Jill&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Jack&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;John&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Jenny&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that we don&rsquo;t follow the function name with the parenthesis (<code>()</code>) when we pass it.  If we did, we&rsquo;d inovke the function <em>at that point</em> and what we&rsquo;d pass was the return value of the function, not the function itself.</p>
<h2 id="return-values">Return Values</h2>
<p>Just like the functions you&rsquo;re used to, JavaScript functions can return a value with the <code>return</code> statement, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">foo</span>() { 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also return nothing, which is <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">bar</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is useful when we want to stop execution immediately, but don&rsquo;t have a real return value.  Also, if we don&rsquo;t specify a return value, we <em>implicity</em> return <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>And, because JavaScript has first-order functions, we can return a function:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">giveMeAFunction</span>() {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="function-variables">Function Variables</h2>
<p>Because JavaScript has first-order functions, we can also assign a function to a variable, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">myFn</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">b</span>) {<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">b</span>;}

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">oneMoreFn</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">giveMeAFunction</span>();</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="functional-scope">Functional Scope</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned scope several times now.  Remember, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">scope</a>
 simply refers to where a binding between a symbol and a value is valid (here the symbol could be a <code>var</code> or <code>function</code> name).  JavaScript uses <em>functional scope</em>, which means a new scope is created within the body of every function.  Moreover, the parent scope of that function remains accessible as well.</p>
<p>Consider the JavaScript code:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span>;

<ol>
<li>Before we invoke <code>coolStuff()</code> the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;bar&quot;</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Inside the body of <code>coolStuff()</code>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The named argument <code>c</code> is assigned the value passed when <code>coolStuff()</code> is invoked - in this case, the value of <code>b</code> at the time, <code>&quot;bar&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>A new variable <code>a</code> is declared, and set to a value of <code>1</code>.  This <code>a</code> only exists within <code>coolStuff()</code>, the old <code>a</code> remains unchanged outside of the function body.</li>
<li>The value of <code>4</code> is assigned to the variable <code>b</code>.  Note that we did not declare a new <code>var</code>, so this is the same <code>b</code> as outside the body of the function.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>After the function is invoked, we go back to our original <code>a</code> which kept the value <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> but our <code>b</code> was changed to <code>4</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That may not seem to bad.  But let&rsquo;s try another example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">three</span>();
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we have nested functions, each with its own scope, and its own variable <code>a</code> that exists for that scope.</p>
<h2 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h2>
<p>Most imperative programming langauges use <em>block scope</em>, which creates a new scope within any block of code.  This includes function bodies, but also loop bodies and conditional blocks.  Consider this snippet:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span><span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">j</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">j</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What will be printed for the value of <code>j</code> after the loop runs?</p>
<p>You might think it should have been <code>undefined</code>, and it certainly would have been a null exception in an imperative language like Java, as the variable <code>j</code> was defined within the block of the <code>for</code> loop. Because those languages have <em>block scope</em>, anything declared within that scope only exists there.</p>
<p>However, with JavaScript&rsquo;s <em>functional</em> scope, a new scope is only created within the body of a function - not loop and conditional blocks!  So anything created within a conditional block actually exists <em>in the scope of the function it appears in</em>.  This can cause some headaches.</p>
<p>Try running this (admittedly contrived) example in the console:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span><span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">setTimeout</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }, <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout" target="_blank">setTimeout()</a>
 will trigger the supplied function body 10 ms in the future.</p>
<p>Notice how all the values are 10?  That&rsquo;s because we were accessing the same variable <code>i</code>, because it was in the same scope each time!</p>
<p>The keyword <code>let</code> was introduced in ES6 to bring block scope to JavaScript.  If we use it instead, we see the behavior we&rsquo;re more used to:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>; <span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span><span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">setTimeout</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">i</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }, <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>You might have noticed we used an array in discussing the <code>for .. in</code> loop, but didn&rsquo;t talk about it in our data type discussion.  This is because in JavaScript, an <code>array</code> is not a primitive data type.  Rather, it&rsquo;s a special kind of <code>object</code>.</p>
<p>This is one of those aspects of JavaScript that breaks strongly with imperative languages.  Brandon Eich drew heavily from Scheme, which is a functional language that focuses heavily on list processing&hellip; and the JavaScript array actually has more to do with lists than it does arrays.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-arrays">Declaring Arrays</h2>
<p>JavaScript arrays can be declared using literal syntax:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">3.2</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>];</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice how we can put any kind of data type into our array?  We can also put an array in an array:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arr2</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>, [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>], [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bar&#34;</span>]];</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can create the effect of an n-dimensional array, though in practice we&rsquo;re creating what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array" target="_blank">jagged arrays</a>
 in computer science.</p>
<p>Clearly if we can do this, the JavaScript array is a very different beast than a Java or C# one.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-array-values">Accessing Array Values</h2>
<p>We can access an element in an array with bracket notation, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foo&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">3.2</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>];
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>])</span></span></code></pre></div><p>will print <code>true</code>.  We index arrays starting at 0, just as we are used to .<br>
But what if we try accessing an index that is &ldquo;out of bounds&rdquo;?  Try it:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>];
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>]);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We don&rsquo;t get an exception, just an <code>undefined</code>, because that value doesn&rsquo;t exist yet. Let&rsquo;s take the same array and give it a value there:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>]);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we see our value.  But what about the values between <code>arr[3]</code> and <code>arr[80]</code>?  If we try printing them, we&rsquo;ll see a value of <code>undefined</code>.  But remember how we said an array is a special kind of object?  Let&rsquo;s iterate over its keys and values with a <code>for .. in</code> loop:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">key</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">in</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`The index </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">key</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> has value </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">arr</span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">key</span>]<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice how we only print values for indices 0,1,2,3, and 80?  The array is really just a special case of the <code>object</code>, using indices as property keys to store values. Everything in the array is effectively stored by reference&hellip; which means all the rules we learned about optimizing array algorithms won&rsquo;t apply here.</p>
<h2 id="arrays-as-special-purpose-data-structures">Arrays as Special-Purpose Data Structures</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also learned about a lot of specialty data structures in prior courses - stacks, queues, etc.  Before you write one in JavaScript though, you may be interested to know that JavaScript arrays can emulate these with their built-in methods.</p>
<p><strong>Stacks</strong> We push new elements to the top of the stack, and pop them off.  The array methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push" target="_blank">push()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop" target="_blank">pop()</a>
 duplicate this behavior by pushing and popping items from the end of the array.</p>
<p><strong>FIFO queues</strong> A first-in-first-out queue can be mimicked with the array methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push" target="_blank">push()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift" target="_blank">shift()</a>
 which push new items to the end of the array and remove the first item, respectively.</p>
<p>Another useful method is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift" target="_blank">unshift()</a>
, which adds a new element to the front of the array.</p>
<p>Most data types you&rsquo;ve learned about in prior courses can be emulated with some combination of JavaScript arrays and objects, including various flavors of trees, priority queues, and tries.  Granted, these will not be as performant as their equivalents written in C, but they will serve for most web app needs.</p>
<h2 id="map-reduce">Map Reduce</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful patterns JavaScript adopted from list-processing languages is the map and reduce patterns.  You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank">MapReduce</a>
 in terms of Big Data - that is exactly these two patterns used in combination. Let&rsquo;s examine how they are used in JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="map">Map</h3>
<p>The basic idea of mapping is to process a list one element at a time, returning a new list containing the processed elements.  In JavaScript, we implement it with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="_blank">map()</a>
 method of the array. It takes a function as an argument, which is invoked on each item in the array, and returns the newly processed array (the old array stays the same).</p>
<p>The function supplied to <em>map()</em> is supplied with three arguments - the item currently iterated, the index of the item in the array, and a reference to the original array. Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to define your function with the second or third arguments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try a simple example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">squares</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>].<span style="color:#a6e22e">map</span>((<span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>) =&gt; {<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>})</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code squares each of the numbers in the array, and sets <code>squares</code> to have as a value the array of newly-created squares.</p>
<p>Notice too how by passing a function into the map function, we create a new scope for each iteration?  This is how JavaScript has long dealt with the challenge of functional scope - by using functions!</p>
<h3 id="reduce">Reduce</h3>
<p>The reduce pattern also operates on a list, but it <em>reduces</em> the list to a single result.  In JavaScript, it is implemented with the array&rsquo;s <a href="">reduce()</a>
 method.  The method takes two arguments - a reducer function and an initial accumulator value.  Each time the reduce function iterates, it performs an operation on the currently iterated item and the accumulator.  The accumulator is then passed forward to the next iteration, until it is returned at the end.</p>
<p>The function supplied to <em>reduce</em> has four arguments - the current accumulator value, the current iterated item, the item&rsquo;s index, and the original array.  As with <code>map()</code>, we can leave out the last two arguments if we don&rsquo;t need to use them.</p>
<p>A common example of <code>reduce()</code> in action is to sum an array:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sum</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>].<span style="color:#a6e22e">reduce</span>((<span style="color:#a6e22e">acc</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>) =&gt; {<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">acc</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>}, <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We supply the initial value of the accumulator as identity for addition, <code>0</code>, and each iteration the current item in the array is added to it.  At the end, the final value is returned.</p>
<h3 id="mapreduce">MapReduce</h3>
<p>And as we said before, MapReduce is a combination of the two, i.e. we can calculate the sum of squares by combining our two examples:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sumOfSquares</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>].<span style="color:#a6e22e">map</span>((<span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>) =&gt; {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}).<span style="color:#a6e22e">reduce</span>((<span style="color:#a6e22e">acc</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>) =&gt; {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">acc</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">item</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice how we invoked the <code>map()</code> function on the original array, and then invoked <code>reduce()</code> on the returned array?  This is a syntax known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining" target="_blank">method chaining</a>
, which can make for concise code. We could also have assigned each result to a variable, and then invoked the next method on that variable.</p>

<p>JavaScript is also an object-oriented language, but the way it implements objects is derived from the ideas of the Self programming language, rather than the C++ origins of Java and C#&rsquo;s object-oriented approaches.</p>
<h2 id="object-properties">Object Properties</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what an object <em>is</em> in JavaScript.  It&rsquo;s basically a collection of properties - key/value pairs, similar to the concept of a Dictionary in other languages.  The properties play both the role of fields and methods of the object, as a property can be assigned a primitive value or a function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen how to create an object with literal syntax, but let&rsquo;s see another example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">bob</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Bob&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">age</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">29</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">mother</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Mary&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">age</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">53</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Look at the property <code>mother</code> - it is its own object, nested within <code>bob</code>. Objects can nest as deep as we need them to (or at least, until we run out of memory).</p>
<p>We can then access properties with either dot notation or bracket notation, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// dot notation

<h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>A constructor in JavaScript is simply a function that is invoked with the keyword <code>new</code>.  Inside the body of the function, we have access to a variable named <code>this</code>, which can have values assigned to it.  Here is an example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">pooh</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pooh&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There is nothing that inherently distinguishes a constructor from any other function; we can use the <code>new</code> keyword with any function.  However, it only makes sense to do so with functions intended to be used as constructors, and therefore JavaScript programmers have adopted the convention of starting function names intended to be used as constructors with a capital letter, and other functions with a lowercase one.</p>
<h2 id="object-methods">Object Methods</h2>
<p>Methods are simply functions attached to the object as a property, which have access to the <code>this</code> (which refers back to the object) i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">pooh</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">greet</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`My name is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also attach a method to all objects created with a constructor by attaching them to its prototype, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">prototype</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`Grrr.  My name is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> and I&#39;ll eat you up!`</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we can invoke <code>pooh.growl()</code> and see the same message.  If we create a few new Bear instances:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">smokey</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Smokey&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">shardik</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Shardik&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>They also has access to the <code>growl()</code> method, but not <code>greet()</code>, because that was declared on the <code>pooh</code> instance, <em>not</em> the prototype.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t seem appropriate for Smokey the Bear to threaten to eat you.  Let&rsquo;s tweak his behavior:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">smokey</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Only you can prevent forest fires!&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now try invoking:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">smokey</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>();
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">shardik</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>();
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">pooh</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>();</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Pooh and Shardick continue to growl menacingly, but Smokey warns us about the dangers of forest fires.  This leads us to the topic of prototypes.</p>
<h2 id="object-prototypes">Object Prototypes</h2>
<p>JavaScript adopts an approach to inheritance known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" target="_blank">prototype-based programming</a>
, which works a bit differently than you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, each object keeps a reference to its constructor (in fact, you can see this for our bears with <code>pooh.constructor</code>, <code>smokey.constructor</code>, etc.).  Each constructor in turn has a <code>prototype</code> property, which is an <code>object</code> with methods and properties attached to it.</p>
<p>When we invoke <code>pooh.growl()</code>, JavaScript first checks to see if the <code>growl</code> property is defined on the Bear instance we know as <code>pooh</code>.  If not, then it checks the constructor&rsquo;s prototype for the same property.  If it exists, then it invokes it.</p>
<p>Inheritance in JavaScript takes the form of a prototype chain - as each prototype is an <code>object</code>, each prototype can have its own prototype in turn.  Thus, when we invoke a method, the interpreter walks down this chain and invokes the first matching property found.</p>
<h2 id="ecma-script-2015-class-syntax">ECMA Script 2015 Class Syntax</h2>
<p>If you find this all confusing, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re not alone.  ECMAScript decided to introduce a new class syntax in the 2015 version (ES6). It will look a lot more familiar:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">constructor</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">bind</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`Grrr!

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we&rsquo;ve recreated our Bear class using the new syntax.  We can construct a bear the same way, and invoke its <code>growl()</code> method:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">yogi</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Yogi&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">yogi</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>();</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="method-binding">Method Binding</h3>
<p>Under the hood we&rsquo;re still using the same prototypical inheritance, which throws a slight wrench in the works.  Notice the line:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">bind</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>in the constructor?  This uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind" target="_blank">function.prototype.bind</a>
 method to bind the scope of the growl function to the <code>this</code> object of our class (remember, functions start a new scope, and a new scope means a new <code>this</code> object).</p>
<p>So remember when using ES6 class syntax, you need to bind your methods, or declare them in the constructor itself as arrow functions, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Bear</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">constructor</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">growl</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> () =&gt; { 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">`Grrr! My name is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> and I&#39;ll eat you!`</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As the arrow function declaration does not open a new scope, the this object doesn&rsquo;t change, and refers to the bear instance.</p>
<h3 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
<p>Specifying inheritance is also simplified.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Mammal</span> {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remember to always invoke the parent constructor with <code>super()</code> as the first thing in your child class constructor.</p>

<h1 id="attaching-scripts">Attaching Scripts</h1>

<p>Much like there are multiple ways to apply CSS to a web app, there are multiple ways to bring JavaScript into one.  We can use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with a specified <code>src</code> attribute to load a separate document, put our code into the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag directly, or even add code to attributes of an HTML element.  Let&rsquo;s look at each option.</p>
<h2 id="script-tag-with-source">Script Tag with Source</h2>
<p>We can add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with a <code>src</code> attribute that gives a url pointing to a JavaScript file.  This is similar to how we used the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element for CSS:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">title</span>&gt;JS Example&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">title</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">head</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">script</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;example.js&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A couple of important differences though.  First, the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element is not a void tag, so we a closing <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code>.  Also, while traditionally we would also place <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, current best practice is to place them as the last children of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="script-tag-with-content">Script Tag with Content</h2>
<p>The reason the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element isn&rsquo;t a void element is that you can place JavaScript code directly into it - similar to how we used the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element for CSS.  Typically we would also place this tag at the end of the body:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="why-at-the-end-of-the-body">Why at the End of the Body?</h2>
<p>The reason for placing <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the end of the body is twofold. First, JavaScript files have grown increasingly large as web applications have become more sophisticated.  And as they are parsed, there is no visible sign of this in the browser - so it can make your website appear to load more slowly when they are encountered in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.  Second, JavaScript is interpreted as it is loaded - so if your code modifies part of the web page, and tries to do so before the webpage is fully loaded, it may fail.</p>
<p>A good trick is to place any code that should not be run until all the web pages&rsquo; assets have been downloaded within the body of an event handler tied to the <code>'load'</code> event, i.e.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>window.<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;load&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// Put any JavaScript that should not be
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// run until the page has finished loading 
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>  <span style="color:#75715e">// here..
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="as-an-attribute">As an Attribute</h2>
<p>A third alternative is to define our JavaScript as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers" target="_blank">on-event handler</a>
 directly on an element.  For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">button</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">onclick</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;console.log(1+3)&#34;</span>&gt;click me&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">button</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This once-common strategy has fallen out of favor as it does not provide for good separation of concerns, and can be difficult to maintain in large HTML files.  Also, only one event handler can be set using this approach; we&rsquo;ll see an alternative method, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" target="_blank">Element.addEventListener()</a>
 in the next section that is more powerful.</p>
<p>However, component-based development approaches like React&rsquo;s JSX make this approach more sensible, so it has seen some resurgence in interest.</p>
<h2 id="mix-and-match">Mix-and-Match</h2>
<p>It is important to understand that all JavaScript on a page is interpreted within the same scope, regardless of what file it was loaded from.  Thus, you can invoke a function in one file that was defined in a separate file - this is commonly done when incorporating JavaScript libraries like JQuery.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>There is one aspect you need to be aware of though.  Before you reference code artifacts like functions and variables, they must have been loaded in the interpreter.  If you are using external files, these have to be retrieved by the browser as a separate request, and even though they may be declared in order in your HTML, they may be received out of order, and they will be interpreted <em>in the order they are received</em></p>
<p>There are a couple of strategies that can help here.  First, you can use the window&rsquo;s <code>load</code> event as we discussed above to avoid triggering any JavaScript execution until all the script files have been loaded.  And second, we can combine all of our script files into one single file (a process known as <em>concatenation</em>).  This is often done with a build tool that also <em>minifies</em> the resulting code.  We&rsquo;ll explore this strategy later in the course.</p>

<h1 id="the-document-object-model">The Document Object Model</h1>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve reviewed the basic syntax and structure of the JavaScript language, and how to load it into a page, we can turn our attention to what it was created for - to interact with web pages in the browser.  This leads us to the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>.</p>
<p>The DOM is a tree-like structure that is created by the browser when it parses the HTML page.  Then, as CSS rules are interpreted and applied, they are attached to the individual nodes of the tree.  Finally, as the page&rsquo;s JavaScript executes, it may modify the tree structure and node properties.  The browser uses this structure and properties as part of its rendering process.</p>
<h2 id="the-document-instance">The Document Instance</h2>
<p>The DOM is exposed to JavaScript through an instance of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" target="_blank">Document</a>
 class, which is attached to the <code>document</code> property of the window (in the browser, the window is the top-level, a.k.a global scope.  Its properties can be accessed with our without referencing the <code>window</code> object, i.e. <code>window.document</code> and <code>document</code> refer to the same object).</p>
<p>This document instance serves as the entry point for working with the DOM.</p>
<h2 id="the-dom-tree">The Dom Tree</h2>
<p>The DOM tree nodes are instances of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element" target="_blank">Element</a>
 class, which extends from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" target="_blank">Node</a>
 class, which in turn extends the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget" target="_blank">EventTarget</a>
 class. This inheritance chain reflects the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">Separation of Concerns</a>
 design principle: the EventTarget class provides the functionality for responding to events, the Node class provides for managing and traversing the tree structure, and the Element class maintains the element&rsquo;s appearance and properties.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-elements-on-the-page">Selecting Elements on the Page</h3>
<p>One of the most important skills in working with the DOM is understanding how to get a reference to an element on the page.  There are many approaches, but some of the most common are:</p>
<h4 id="selecting-an-element-by-its-id">Selecting an Element by its ID</h4>
<p>If an element has an <code>id</code> attribute, we can select it with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById" target="_blank">Document.getElementByID()</a>
 method.  Let&rsquo;s select our button this way. Add this code to your <em>playground.js</em> file:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">button</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-button&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">button</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You should see the line <code>[object HTMLButtonElement]</code> - the actual instance of the DOM node representing our button (the class HTMLButtonElement is an extension of Element representing a button).</p>
<h4 id="selecting-a-single-element-by-css-selector">Selecting a Single Element by CSS Selector</h4>
<p>While there are additional selectors for selecting by tag name, class name(s), and other attributes, in practice these have largely been displaced by functions that select elements using a CSS selector.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector" target="_blank">Document.querySelector()</a>
 will return the <em>first</em> element matching the CSS selector, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">button</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">querySelector</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;#some-button&#39;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Works exactly like the <code>document.getElementById()</code> example. But we could also do:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">input</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">querySelector</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;input[type=text]&#39;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which would grab the first <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> with attribute <code>type=text</code>.</p>
<h4 id="selecting-multiple-elements-by-css-selector">Selecting Multiple Elements by CSS Selector</h4>
<p>But what if we wanted to select more than one element at a time?  Enter <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll" target="_blank">document.querySelectorAll()</a>
.  It returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList" target="_blank">NodeList</a>
 containing all matching nodes.  So the code:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">paras</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">querySelectorAll</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;p.highlight&#39;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will populate the variable <code>paras</code> with a <code>NodeList</code> containing all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements on the page with the highlight class.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>While a <code>NodeList</code> is an iterable object that behaves much like an array, it is not an array.  Its items can also be directly accessed with bracket notation (<code>[]</code>) or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/item" target="_blank">NodeList.item()</a>
.  It can be iterated over with a <code>for .. of</code> loop, and in newer browsers, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/forEach" target="_blank">NodeList.forEach()</a>
.  Alternatively, it can be converted into an array with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from" target="_blank">Array.from()</a>
.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="elementqueryselector-and-elementqueryselectorall">Element.querySelector() and Element.querySelectorAll()</h4>
<p>The query selector methods are also implemented on the element class, with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector" target="_blank">Element.querySelector()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll" target="_blank">Element.querySelectorAll()</a>
.  Instead of searching the entire document, these only search their descendants for matching elements.</p>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>Once we have a reference to an element, we can add an event listener with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" target="_blank">EventTarget.addEventListener()</a>
.  This takes as its first argument, the name of the event to listen for, and as the second, a method to invoke when the event occurs.  There are additional optional arguments as well (such as limiting an event listener to firing only once), see the MDN documentation for more details.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to log when the user clicks our button, we could use the code:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-button&#34;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;click&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">event</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">event</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">preventDefault</span>();
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Button was clicked!&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice we are once again using method chaining - we could also assign the element to a <code>var</code> and invoke <code>addEventListener()</code> on the variable.  The event we want to listen for is identified by its name - the string <code>'click'</code>.  Finally, our event handler function will be invoked with an event object as its first argument.</p>
<p>Also, note the use of <code>event.preventDefault()</code>.  Invoking this method on the event tells it that we are taking care of its responsibilities, so no need to trigger the default action. If we don&rsquo;t do this, the event will continue to bubble up the DOM, triggering any additional event handlers.  For example, if we added a <code>'click'</code> event to an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element and did not invoke <code>event.preventDefault()</code>, when we clicked the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag we would run our custom event handler and then the browser would load the page that the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element&rsquo;s <code>href</code> attribute pointed to.</p>
<h4 id="common-event-names">Common Event Names</h4>
<p>The most common events you&rsquo;ll likely use are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;click&quot;</code> triggered when an item is clicked on</li>
<li><code>&quot;input&quot;</code> triggered when an input element receives input</li>
<li><code>&quot;change&quot;</code> triggered when an input&rsquo;s value changes</li>
<li><code>&quot;load&quot;</code> triggered when the source of a image or other media has finished loading</li>
<li><code>&quot;mouseover&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;mouseout&quot;</code> triggered when the mouse moves over an element or moves off an element</li>
<li><code>&quot;mousedown&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;mouseup&quot;</code> triggered when the mouse button is initially pressed and when it is released (primarily used for drawing and drag-and-drop)</li>
<li><code>&quot;mousemove&quot;</code> triggered when the mouse moves (used primarily for drawing and drag-and-drop)</li>
<li><code>&quot;keydown&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;keyup&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;keypressed&quot;</code> triggered when a key is first pushed down, released, and held.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the mouse and key events are only passed to elements when they have <em>focus</em>.  If you want to always catch these events, attach them to the <code>window</code> object.</p>
<p>There are many more events - refer to the MDN documentation of the specific element you are interested in to see the full list that applies to that element.</p>
<h4 id="event-objects">Event Objects</h4>
<p>The function used as the event handler is invoked with an object representing the event.  In most cases, this is a descendant class of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event" target="_blank">Event</a>
 that has additional properties specific to the event type.  Let&rsquo;s explore this a bit with our text input.  Add this code to your <em>playground.js</em>, reload the page, and type something into the text input:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-input&#34;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;input&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">event</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">event</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">target</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we access the event&rsquo;s <code>target</code> property, which gives us the target element for the event, the original <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.  The input element has the <code>value</code> property, which corresponds to the <code>value</code> attribute of the HTML that was parsed to create it, and it changes as text is entered into the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-dom-element-properties">Modifying DOM Element Properties</h3>
<p>One of the primary uses of the DOM is to alter properties of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element" target="_blank">element</a>
 objects in the page. Any changes to the DOM structure and properties are almost immediately applied to the appearance of the web page. Thus, we use this approach to alter the document in various ways.</p>
<h4 id="attributes">Attributes</h4>
<p>The attributes of an HTML element can be accessed and changed through the DOM, with the methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute" target="_blank">element.getAttribute()</a>
, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute" target="_blank">element.hasAttribute()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute" target="_blank">element.setAttribute()</a>
.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit the button in our playground, and add an event listener to change the input element&rsquo;s <code>value</code> attribute:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-button&#34;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;click&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">event</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-input&#34;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">setAttribute</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;value&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice too that <em>both</em> event handlers we have assigned to the button trigger when you click it.  We can add as many event handlers as we like to a project.</p>
<h4 id="styles">Styles</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style" target="_blank">style</a>
 property provides access to the element&rsquo;s inline styles.  Thus, we can set style properties on the element:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span>document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;some-button&#34;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">style</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;background-color: yellow&#34;</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remember from our discussion of the CSS cascade that inline styles have the highest priority.</p>
<h4 id="class-names">Class Names</h4>
<p>Alternatively, we can change the CSS classes applied to the element by changing its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList" target="_blank">element.classList</a>
 property, which is an instance of a DOMTokensList, which exposes the methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>add()</code> which takes one or more string arguments which are class names added to the class list</li>
<li><code>remove()</code> which takes one or more string arguments which are class names removed from the class list</li>
<li><code>toggle()</code> which takes one or more strings as arguments and toggles the class name in the list (i.e. if the class name is there, it is removed, and if not, it is added)</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding, removing, or toggling class names on an element, we can alter what CSS rules apply to it based on its CSS selector.</p>
<h3 id="altering-the-document-structure">Altering the Document Structure</h3>
<p>Another common use for the DOM is to add, remove, or relocate elements in the DOM tree.  This in turn alters the page that is rendered.  For example, let&rsquo;s add a paragraph element to the page just after the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">p</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">createElement</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;p&#39;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">p</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">innerHTML</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Now I see you&#34;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">body</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">insertBefore</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">p</span>, document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">querySelector</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;h1&#39;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">nextSibling</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s walk through this code line-by-line.</p>
<ol>
<li>Here we use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement" target="_blank">Document.createElement()</a>
 to create a new element for the DOM.  At this point, the element is <em>unattached</em> to the document, which means it will not be rendered.</li>
<li>Now we alter the new <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, adding the words <code>&quot;Now I see you&quot;</code> with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML" target="_blank">Element.innerHTML</a>
 property.</li>
<li>Then we attach the new <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag to the DOM tree, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore" target="_blank">Node.insertBefore()</a>
 method and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nextSibling" target="_blank">Node.nextSibling</a>
 property.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" target="_blank">Node</a>
 interface provides a host of properties and methods for traversing, adding to, and removing from, the DOM tree.  Some of the most commonly used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentNode" target="_blank">Node.parent</a>
 the parent of this Node</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/childNodes" target="_blank">Node.childNodes</a>
 a <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/07-the-dom/NodeList">NodeList</a>
 of this node&rsquo;s children</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nextSibling" target="_blank">Node.nextSibling</a>
 returns the node following this one at the same level in the DOM tree</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/previousSibling" target="_blank">Node.previousSibling</a>
 returns the node proceeding this one in the DOM tree at the same level</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild" target="_blank">Node.appendChild()</a>
 adds the an element as the last child of the node</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild" target="_blank">Node.removeChild()</a>
 removes a child from the node and returns it (this means the element becomes <em>unattached</em>)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/replaceChild" target="_blank">Node.replaceChild()</a>
 replaces a child element with another</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="strict-mode">Strict Mode</h1>

<p>JavaScript has been around a long time, and a lot of JavaScript code has been written by inexperienced programmers.  Browser manufacturers compensated for this by allowing lenient interpretation of JavaScript programs, and by ignoring many errors as they occurred.</p>
<p>While this made poorly-written scripts run, arguably they didn&rsquo;t run well.  In ECMA5, <em>strict mode</em> was introduced to solve the problems of lenient interpretation.</p>
<p>Strict mode <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" target="_blank">according to the Mozilla Developer Network</a>
:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
<li>Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that&rsquo;s not strict mode.</li>
<li>Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can place the interpreter in strict mode by including this line at the start of your JavaScript file:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;use strict&#34;</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In interpreters that don&rsquo;t support strict mode, this expression will be interpreted as a string and do nothing.</p>

<p>The JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>
 prototype has some very powerful methods, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes" target="_blank">String.prototype.includes()</a>
 which recognizes when a string contains a substring - i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;foobarwhen&#34;</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">includes</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bar&#34;</span>)</span></span></code></pre></div><p>would evaluate to true.  But what if you needed a more general solution?  Say, to see if the text matched a phone number pattern like XXX-XXX-XXXX?  That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a>
 come in.</p>
<p>Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that define a <em>pattern</em> that can be searched for within a string.  Unlike substrings, these patterns can have a <em>lot</em> of flexibility.  For example, the phone number pattern above can be expressed as a JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp" target="_blank">RegExp</a>
 like this:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break down what each part means.  First, the enclosing forward slashes (<code>/</code>) indicate this is a RegExp literal, the same way single or double quotes indicate a string literal.  The backslash d (<code>\d</code>) indicates a decimal character, and will match a 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9.  The three in brackets <code>{3}</code> is a quantifier, indicating there should be three of the proceeding character - so three decimal characters.  And the dash (<code>-</code>) matches the actual dash character.</p>
<h2 id="writing-regular-expressions-and-scriptular">Writing Regular Expressions and Scriptular</h2>
<p>As you can see, regular expressions make use of a decent number of special characters, and can be tricky to write.  One of the greatest tools in your arsenal when dealing with Regular Expressions is the web app <a href="https://scriptular.com/" target="_blank">Scriptular.com</a> (click the link to open it in a new tab).  It lists characters with special meanings for regular expressions on the right, and provides an interactive editor on the left, where you can try out regular expressions against target text.</p>
<p>You can, of course, do the same thing on the console, but I find that using Scriptular to prototype regular expressions is faster.  You can also clone the <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/scriptular" target="_blank">Scriptular Github repo</a>
 and use it locally rather than on the internet.  A word of warning, however, always test your regular expressions in the context you are going to use them - sometimes something that works in Scriptular doesn&rsquo;t quite in the field (especially with older browsers and Node versions).</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions-and-input-validation">Regular Expressions and Input Validation</h2>
<p>So how are regular expressions used in Web Development?  One common use is to <em>validate</em> user input - to make sure the user has entered values in the format we want.  To see if a user entered string matches the phone format we declared above, for example, we can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test" target="_blank">RegExp.prototype.test()</a>
 method.  It returns the boolean <code>true</code> if a match is found, <code>false</code> otherwise:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">test</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">userEnteredString</span>)) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;String was valid&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>} <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">console</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">log</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;String was Invalid&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But what if we wanted to allow phone numbers in more than one format?  Say X-XXX-XXX-XXXX, (XXX)XXX-XXXX, and X(XXX)XXX-XXXX)?</p>
<p>We can do this as well:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">/\d?-?\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}|\d?\s?\(\d{3}\)\s?\d{3}-\d{4}/</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The pipe (<code>|</code>) in the middle of the RexExp acts like an OR; we can match against the pattern before OR the pattern after.  The first pattern is almost the same as the one we started with, but with a new leading <code>\d</code> and <code>-</code>.  These use the quantifier <code>?</code>, which indicates 0 or 1 instances of the character.</p>
<p>The second pattern is similar, except we use a backslash s (<code>/s</code>) to match whitespace characters (we could also use the literal space <code> </code>, <code>\s</code> also matches tabs and newlines).  And we look for parenthesis, but as parenthesis have special meaning for RegExp syntax, we must escape them with a backslash: (<code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code>).</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions-and-form-validation">Regular Expressions and Form Validation</h2>
<p>In fact, the use of Regular Expressions to validate user input is such a common use-case that when HTML5 introduced <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation" target="_blank">form data validation</a>
 it included the <code>pattern</code> attribute for HTML5 forms.  It instructs the browser to mark a form field as invalid unless input matching the pattern is entered.  Thus, the HTML:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">label</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">for</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;phone&#34;</span>&gt;Please enter a phone number
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">input</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;phone&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">pattern</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">placeholder</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;xxx-xxx-xxxx&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">label</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will ensure that only validly formatted phone numbers can be submitted. Also, note that we omitted the leading and trailing forward slashes (<code>/</code>) with the <code>pattern</code> attribute.</p>
<p>However, be aware that older browsers may not have support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation" target="_blank">HTML5 form data validation</a>
 (though all modern ones do), and that a savvy user can easily disable HTML5 form validation with the Developer Tools.  Thus, you should aways validate on both the client-side (for good user experience) <em>and</em> the server-side (to ensure clean data).  We&rsquo;ll discuss data validation more in our chapter on persisting data on the server.</p>
<h2 id="constructing-regexp">Constructing RegExp</h2>
<p>Besides using literal notation, We can also <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp" target="_blank">construct regular expressions</a>
 from a string of characters:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">regexp</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> RegExp(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}&#34;</span>)</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is especially useful if we won&rsquo;t know the pattern until runtime, as we can create our regular expression &ldquo;on the fly.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="regexp-flags">RegExp flags</h2>
<p>You can also specify one or more flags when defining a JavaScript Regular Expression, by listing the flag after the literal, i.e. in the RegExp:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/g</span> 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The flag <code>g</code> means <em>global</em>, and will find <em>all</em> matches, not just the first.  So if we wanted to find all phone numbers in a body of text, we could do:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/g</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">match</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">bodyOfText</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match" target="_blank">RegExp.prototype.match()</a>
 function returns an array of phone numbers that matched the pattern and were found in <code>bodyOfText</code>.</p>
<p>The flags defined for JavaScript regular expressions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>g</code> global match - normally RegExp execution stops after the first match.</li>
<li><code>i</code> ignore case - upper and lowercase versions of a letter are treated equivalently</li>
<li><code>m</code> multiline - makes the beginning end operators (<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>) operate on lines rather than the whole string.</li>
<li><code>s</code> dotAll - allows <code>.</code> to match newlines (normally <code>.</code> is a wildcard matching everything <em>but</em> newline characters)</li>
<li><code>u</code> unicode - treat pattern as a sequence of unicode code points</li>
<li><code>y</code>sticky - matches only from the <code>lastIndex</code> property of the Regular Expression</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capture-groups">Capture Groups</h2>
<p>We saw above how we can retrieve the strings that matched our regular expression patterns
Matching patterns represents only <em>part</em> of the power of regular expressions.  One of the most useful features is the ability to <em>capture</em> pieces of the pattern, and expose them to the programmer.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the common case where we have a comma delimited value (CSV) file where we need to tweak some values.  Say perhaps we have one like this:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Name,weight,height
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>John Doe,150,6&#39;2&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Sara Smith,102,5&#39;8&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&#34;Mark Zed, the Third&#34;,250,5&#39;11&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... 100&#39;s more values....</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which is part of a scientific study where they need the weight in Kg and the height in meters.  We could make the changes by hand - but who wants to do that?  We could also do the changes by opening the file in Excel, but that would also involve a lot of copy/paste and deletion, opening the door to human error. Or we can tweak the values with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Notice how the Mark Zed entry, because it has a comma in the name, is wrapped in double quotes, while the other names aren&rsquo;t?  This would make using something like <a href="">String.prototype.split()</a>
 impossible to use without a ton of additional logic, because it splits on the supplied delimiter (in this case, a comma), and would catch these additional commas.  However, because a RegExp matches a <em>pattern</em>, we can account for this issue.</p>
<p>But we want to go one step farther, and <em>capture</em> the weight and height values.  We can create a <em>capture group</em> by surrounding part of our pattern with parenthesis, i.e. the RegExp:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">/^([\d\s\w]+|&#34;[\d\s\w,]+&#34;),(\d+),(\d+&#39;\d+)&#34;$/gm</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will match each line in the file.  Let&rsquo;s take a look at each part:</p>
<p><code>/^ ... $/mg</code> the <code>m</code> flag indicates that <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> should mark the start and end of each line.  This makes sure we only capture values from the same line as par to a match, and the <code>g</code> flag means we want to find all matching lines in the file.</p>
<p><code>([\d\s\w]+|&quot;[\d\s\w,]+&quot;)</code> is our first capture group, and we see it has two options (separated by <code>|</code>).  The square brackets (<code>[]</code>) represent a set of characters, and we&rsquo;ll match any character(s) listed inside.  So <code>[\d\s\w]</code> means any decimal (<code>\d</code>), whitespace (<code>\s</code>), or word (<code>\w</code>) character, and the <code>+</code> means one or more of these.  The second option is <em>almost</em> the same as the first, but surrounded by double quotes (<code>&quot;</code>) and includes commas (<code>,</code>) in the set of matching characters.  This means the first group will always match our name field, even if it has commas.</p>
<p><code>,(\d+),</code> is pretty simple - we match the comma between name and weight columns, capture the weight value, and then the comma between weight and height.</p>
<p><code>(\d+'\d+)&quot;</code> is a bit more interesting.  We capture the feet value (<code>\d+</code>), the apostrophe (<code>'</code>) indicating the unit of feet, and the inches value (<code>\d+</code>).  While we match the units for inches (<code>&quot;</code>), it is not part of the capture group.</p>
<p>So our line-by-line captures would be:</p>
<pre>
Line 0: No match
Line 1: John Doe, 150, 6'2
Line 2: Sara Smith, 102, 5'8
Line 3: "Mark Zed, the Third", 250, 5'11
</pre>
<p>We can use this knowledge with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace" target="_blank">String.prototype.replace()</a>
 to reformat the values in our file.  The <code>replace()</code> can work as you are probably used to - taking two strings - one to search for and one to use as a replacement.  But it can also take a RegExp as a <em>pattern</em> to search for and replace.  And the replacement value can also be a <em>function</em>, which receives as its parameters 1) the full match to the pattern, and 2) the capture group values, as subsequent parameters.</p>
<p>Thus, for the Line 1 match, it would be invoked with parameters: <code>(&quot;John Doe,150,6'2\&quot;&quot;, &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;150&quot;, &quot;6'2\&quot;&quot;)</code>.  We can use this understanding to write our conversion function:</p>

<p>JSON is an acronym for <em>JavaScript Object Notation</em>, a serialization format that was developed in conjunction with ECMAScript 3.  It is a standard format, as set by <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf" target="_blank">ECMA-404</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="json-format">JSON Format</h2>

Two differences probably stand out: First, references (like whilma and pebbles) are replaced with a JSON representation of their values.  And second, all property names (the keys) are expressed as strings, not JavaScript symbols.</p>
<p>A discussion of the full syntax can be found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a>
 and also at <a href="https://json.org/" target="_blank">json.org</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="the-json-object">The JSON Object</h2>
<p>The JavaScript language provides a JSON object with two very useful functions: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify" target="_blank">JSON.stringify()</a>
 and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse" target="_blank">JSON.parse()</a>
.  The first converts any JavaScript variable into a JSON string.  Similarly, the second method parses a JSON string and returns what it represents.</p>
<p>The <code>JSON</code> object is available in browsers and in Node.  Open the console and try converting objects and primitives to JSON strings with <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and back with <code>JSON.parse()</code>.</p>

<p>While JSON was developed in conjunction with JavaScript, it has become a popular exchange format for other languages as well.  There are parsing libraries for most major programming languages that can convert JSON strings into native objects:</p>

<h1 id="ajax">AJAX</h1>

<p>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a term coined by Jesse James Garrett to describe a technique of using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" target="_blank">XMLHttpRequest</a>
 object to request resources directly from JavaScript.  As the name implies, this was originally used to request XML content, but the technique can be used with any kind of data.</p>
<h3 id="the-xmlhttprequest">The XMLHttpRequest</h3>
<p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is modeled after how the <code>window</code> object makes web requests.  You can think of it as a state machine that can be in one of several possible states, defined by both a constant and an unsigned short value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNSENT</strong> or <strong>0</strong> The client has been created, but no request has been made.  Analogus to a just-opened browser before you type an address in the address bar.</li>
<li><strong>OPENED</strong> or <strong>1</strong> The request has been made, but the response has not been received.  The browser analogue would be you have just pressed enter after typing the address.</li>
<li><strong>HEADERS_RECIEVED</strong> or <strong>2</strong> The first part of the response has been processed.  We&rsquo;ll talk about headers in the next chapter.</li>
<li><strong>LOADING</strong> or <strong>3</strong> The content of the response is being downloaded.  In the browser, this would be the stage where the HTML is being received and parsed into the DOM.</li>
<li><strong>DONE</strong> or <strong>4</strong> The resource is fully loaded.  In the DOM, this would be equivalent to the <code>'load'</code> event.</li>
</ul>

</a></p>
<h4 id="xmlhttprequest-properties">XMLHttpRequest Properties</h4>
<p>The XMLHttpRequest object also has a number of properties that are helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>readyState</code> - the current state of the property</li>
<li><code>response</code> - the body of the response, an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, <code>Blob</code>, <code>Document</code>, or <code>DOMString</code> based on the value of the <code>responseType</code></li>
<li><code>responseType</code> - the mime type of response</li>
<li><code>status</code> - returns an unsigned short with the HTTP response status (or 0 if the response has not been received)</li>
<li><code>statusText</code> - returns a string containing the response string fro the server, i.e. <code>&quot;200 OK&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>timeout</code> - the number of milliseconds the request can take before being terminated</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="xmlhttprequest-events">XMLHttpRequest Events</h4>
<p>The XMLHttpRequest object implements the <code>EventTarget</code> interface, just like the <code>Element</code> and <code>Node</code> of the DOM, so we can attach event listeners with <code>addEventListener()</code>.  The specific events we can listen for are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>abort</code> - fired when the request has been aborted (you can abort a request with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/abort" target="_blank">XMLHttpRequest.abort()</a>
 method)</li>
<li><code>error</code> - fired when the request encountered an error</li>
<li><code>load</code> - fired when the request completes successfully</li>
<li><code>loadend</code> - fired when the request has completed, either because of success or after an abort or error.</li>
<li><code>loadstart</code> - fired when the request has started to load data</li>
<li><code>progress</code> - fired periodically as the request receives data</li>
<li><code>timeout</code> - fired when the progress is expired due to taking too long</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these events have properties you can assign a function to directly to capture the event:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onerror</code> - corresponds to the <code>error</code> event</li>
<li><code>onload</code> - corresponds to the <code>load</code> event</li>
<li><code>onloadend</code> - corresponds to the <code>loadend</code> event</li>
<li><code>onloadstart</code> - corresponds to the <code>loadstart</code> event</li>
<li><code>onprogress</code> - corresponds to the <code>progress</code> event</li>
<li><code>ontimeout</code> - corresponds to the <code>timeout</code> event</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there is an <code>onreadystatechange</code> property which acts like one of these properties and is fired every time the state of the request changes.  In older code, you may see it used instead of the <code>load</code> event, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">onreadystatechange</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span>(){
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">readyState</span> <span style="color:#f92672">===</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">status</span> <span style="color:#f92672">===</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">200</span>) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#75715e">// Request has finished successfully, do logic
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="using-ajax">Using AJAX</h3>
<p>Of course the point of learning about the XMLHttpRequest object is to perform AJAX requests.  So let&rsquo;s turn our attention to that task.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-xmlhttprequest">Creating the XMLHttpRequest</h4>
<p>The first step in using AJAX is creating the XMLHttpRequest object. To do so, we simply call its constructor, and assign it to a variable:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">XMLHttpRequest</span>();</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can create as many of these requests as we want, so if we have multiple requests to make, we&rsquo;ll usually create a new XMLHttpRequest object for each.</p>
<h4 id="attaching-the-event-listeners">Attaching the Event Listeners</h4>
<p>Usually, we&rsquo;ll want to attach our event listener(s) before doing anything else with the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object.  The reason is simple - because the request happens asynchronously, it is entirely possible the request will be finished <em>before</em> we add the event listener to listen for the <code>load</code> event.  In that case, our listener will <em>never</em> trigger.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you probably want to listen to <code>load</code> events, i.e.:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;load&#39;</span>, () =&gt; {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e">// do something with xhr object
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But it is also a good idea to listen for the <code>error</code> event as well:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;error&#39;</span>, () =&gt; {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e">// report the error
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>});</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="opening-the-xmlhttprequest">Opening the XMLHttpRequest</h4>
<p>Much like when we manually made requests, we first need to open the connection to the server.  We do this with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open" target="_blank">XMLHttpRequest.open()</a>
 method:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">open</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;GET&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/blogofractal.png&#39;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first argument is the <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/06-request-methods/">HTTP request method</a>
 to use, and the second is the <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/02-uris-and-urls/">URL</a>
 to open.</p>
<p>There are also three optional parameters that can be used to follow - a boolean determining if the request should be made asynchronously (default <code>true</code>) and a user and password for HTTP authentication.  Since AJAX requests are normally made asynchronously, and HTTP authentication has largely been displaced by more secure authentication approaches, these are rarely used.</p>
<h4 id="setting-headers">Setting Headers</h4>
<p>After the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> has been opened, but before it is sent, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/setRequestHeader" target="_blank">XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader()</a>
 to set any <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/07-request-headers/">request headers</a>
 you need.  For example, we might set an <code>Accept</code> header to <code>image/png</code> to indicate we would like image data as our response:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">setRequestHeader</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Accept&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;image/png&#39;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="sending-the-xmlhttprequest">Sending the XMLHttpRequest</h4>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/send" target="_blank">XMLHttpRequest.send()</a>
 method will send the request asynchronously (unless the <code>async</code> parameter in <code>XMLHttpRequest.open()</code> was set to <code>false</code>).  As the response is received (or fails) the appropriate event handlers will be triggered.  To finish our example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">xhr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">send</span>();</span></span></code></pre></div>

<h1 id="javascript-libraries">JavaScript Libraries</h1>

<p>Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve been focused on core JavaScript functionality. However, there are <em>lots</em> of additional JavaScript libraries you can use in your web development efforts. A library is a collection of source code that is <em>intended</em> to be used in other projects. Unlike core libraries, these are written by third parties, and often released under an open-source license which describes how they can legally be used in your projects.</p>
<p>One of the more important and well-known early JavaScript libraries is <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>
. JQuery provides many features to support DOM manipulation, and also provides a wrapper that simplifies making AJAX requests.  It was created at a time when browser implementations of JavaScript were inconsistent and often incomplete (especially Internet Explorer) and thus became an important tool for making sure your JavaScript code executed the same in all major browsers.  Over time the features it introduced have been folded into core JavaScript, and browsers have improved their support. While this has reduced the need for JQuery, many legacy sites are still written using it, and many developers prefer its more abbreviated syntax to vanilla JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another library for simplifying requests is <a href="https://axios-http.com/docs/intro" target="_blank">Axios</a>
.  Like JQuery, it simplifies making AJAX calls, and adds support for handling redirects, authentication, and other challenging kinds of HTTP requests.</p>
<p>A third category of JavaScript library works in conjunction with CSS libraries to bring cohesive functionality like dialog boxes, dynamically tiled layouts, infinite scrolls, and other features to your web applications.  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
 is perhaps the best known of these. <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>
 provides support for generating graphs and other views of data. Other libraries provide extra control for drawing with the Canvas or SVG elements.</p>
<p>Finally, there are libraries that represent full rendering frameworks, like <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>
, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>
, and <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a>
. These libraries are used to <em>generate</em> the contents of a webpage from data, rather than writing the HTML directly. Moreover, they are what is known as a <em>single-page application</em> as the webpage they create is dynamic and interactive, essentially its own program.  This kind of application will be discussed in the <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526" target="_blank">web application course</a>
.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>An important consideration when designing a website is how people will work with it. We want to design our websites in a way that they are useable by everyone in our anticipated audience - bet that everyone in the world, university students, employees at our company, or customers of our business. But there is a segment of each of these audiences that is often overlooked - those with disabilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. <br/> - Sir Tim Berners-Lee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Globally, about 15% of the world&rsquo;s population experiences some form of disability. The <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html" target="_blank">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with DIsabilities</a>
 recognizes access to the Web, and the information it makes available, as <strong>a basic human right</strong>. Many countries have followed suit, even codifying accessibility requirements into laws like the <a href="https://beta.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>
.</p>
<p>In short, it is vital when you author a website, you consider how those with disabilities will interact with it.  Moreover, building your website to be accessible will also make your website more usable for <em>all</em> users.</p>

<h1 id="accessibility-standards">Accessibility Standards</h1>

<p>The W3C has crafted a number of accessibility standards, as introduced in the following video <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/" target="_blank">Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SHvU2PKsM">YouTube Video</a>

<p>The specific W3C standards covering web accessibility are:</p>
<h5 id="web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h5>
<p>The WACG is built around four principles for content delivered through the web.  It should be <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Perceivable</strong> - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. <em>This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can&rsquo;t be invisible to all of their senses).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operable</strong> - User interface components and navigation must be operable. <em>This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understandable</strong> - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. <em>This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robust</strong> - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. <em>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="authoring-tool-accessibility-guidelines-atag">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</h5>
<p>These guidelines apply to software tools made to help people author web content (i.e. wikis, content management systems, and web publishing tools).

<h1 id="perceivable-content">Perceivable Content</h1>

<p>What makes web content <em>perceivable</em>? Broadly speaking, the user must be able to <em>see</em> the content through one of their senses. We primarily think about this in terms of sight - the user should be able to see the content of the rendered page. But what we hear can also be a critical piece of perception.</p>
<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p>We often think of vision as the primary sense for engaging with web content - after all we read text and view pictures and videos. So where does perception through vision have potential issues?</p>
<h4 id="screen-resolutions">Screen Resolutions</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by revisiting an idea we covered in Chapter 4, <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/4-css/14-responsive-css/">responsive design</a>
.  When a website that does not use responsive design is viewed on a cell phone screen, it is rendered at a larger screen size, then scaled down to fit in the actual viewport. This helps preserve the layout of the page as it was designed, but also means the text is scaled too small to read, and the user must zoom in and pan to see it. Responsive design avoids this pitfall by using a more appropriate layout on a smaller screen.</p>
<h4 id="browser-zoom">Browser Zoom</h4>
<p>Most browsers also support zooming in and out using either a keyboard shortcut (<code>[ctrl]</code> + <code>[+]</code> to increase, or <code>[ctrl]</code> + <code>[-]</code> to decrease) or a menu option.  This can make it easier to read (much like large-print books), but changes the viewport size much like described above.  Thus, responsive websites work much better with browser zoom.l</p>
<h4 id="screen-magnification">Screen Magnification</h4>
<p>This also reflect the experience of using a computer for many low-vision users. They often utilize magnification tools that are built into modern operating systems to zoom in on a section of the screen. Try it yourself using the tool available on your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198" target="_blank">Windows Magnifier</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210978" target="_blank">Mac Zoom</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/answer/6320705?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Chromebook Magnifier</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006949?hl=en" target="_blank">Android Magnification</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/magnify-nearby-objects-iphe867dc99c/ios" target="_blank">iOS Magnifier</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will likely find that while it makes a portion of the screen easier to see, you now must pan carefully to see the full content of a page.  Keep this in mind as you consider complex layouts where text flows around elements.  While they may be visually appealing at normal sizes, these disjunctions can be difficult to follow when using a magnification tool.</p>
<h4 id="colorblindness">Colorblindness</h4>
<p>Colorblindness is a condition where a person cannot distinguish the difference between certain colors.  It is a very common condition affecting 1 in 12 men, and 1 in 200 women.  Broadly it is categorized into categories by what colors are difficult to perceive differences between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shades of red and green</li>
<li>Shades of blue and yellow</li>
<li>Any colors
In addition, as eyes age the lenses yellow, which causes blue light to scatter when entering the eye.  Older people may therefore have trouble distinguishing shades of blue, green, and violet.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using colors to convey meaning to your users, it is therefore a good idea to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strongly contrasting colors (i.e. opposites on the color wheel, along with highly contrasting shades)</li>
<li>Provide an alternative method for communicating the meaning implied by color choices (i.e. use icons or words along with the color)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="screen-readers">Screen Readers</h4>
<p>A second important tool for the visually impaired is a <em>screen reader</em> - a program that reads the content of a screen.  As with magnifier tools, screen readers are built into modern operating systems. Find yours and give it a try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/chapter-1-introducing-narrator-7fe8fd72-541f-4536-7658-bfc37ddaf9c6#WindowsVersion=Windows_10" target="_blank">Windows Narrator</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Some important things to keep in mind for screen readers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Images should always have a descriptive <code>alt</code> attribute to describe what the image conveys.</li>
<li><a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/tables-layout-absurd/" target="_blank">Table-based layouts</a>
 (a staple of 90&rsquo;s web development) are a bane for screen readers.  Try using a screen reader to read the <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" target="_blank">1996 Space Jam Website</a>
 - you&rsquo;ll quickly see why that is a <em>terrible</em> idea.  Tables should be reserved for tabular data.</li>
<li>Interactive widgets constructed from DOM elements are largely ignored by screen readers, unless you&rsquo;ve used ARIA tag attributes.  Whenever possible, use the widgets that are part of standard HTML, as these will be read correctly. If not, make sure you use ARIA (we&rsquo;ll discuss that soon).</li>
<li>Likewise, elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> don&rsquo;t convey any kind of role to a screen reader.  Consider using the semantic equivalents, i.e. <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> for main content, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> for sidebars, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for navigation elements, etc.  Otherwise, include <code>aria-role</code> attributes in your <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements.</li>
<li>Labels and inputs need to be linked with the <code>for</code> attribute so that the screen reader associates the label with the right input.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p>Other content is delivered through sound - especially video and audio recordings.  Video can (and should) be provided with the option of closed captioning.  Audio and video both can have a script provided.</p>

<h1 id="operable-content">Operable Content</h1>

<p>In short, the user should be able to interact effectively with your website. There are two primary tools we use to interact with websites - the mouse and the keyboard.  Additionally, many assistive technologies mimic one or both of these.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-only-control">Keyboard-Only Control</h3>
<p>While most of us use a mouse as our primary control tool for working with any software, many users cannot use a mouse effectively.  For these users, it is important that the entire web page can be controlled using the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="tab-order">Tab Order</h3>
<p>An important mechanism for replacing mouse movement in a keyboard-only control scheme is the use of the <code>[Tab]</code> key to move focus to a particular element on the page.  Try using your tab key on this page - you&rsquo;ll notice that different interactive elements of the page are highlighted in turn (i.e. links, buttons, videos, inputs, etc.).  Pressing <code>[Enter]</code> while a link is focused will follow the link.  Pressing <code>[Space]</code> will start or stop a media element (video or audio).</p>
<p>The order that the <code>[Tab]</code> key moves through the elements on the page is known as the <em>tab order</em>, and generally will be in the order the elements appear on the page.  However, this can be overridden in HTML by the setting the <code>tabindex</code> attribute.  This attribute can also make an element that is not normally in the tab order (like a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, tabbable).</p>
<h3 id="accessible-rich-internet-applications-aria">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</h3>
<p>Many web applications utilize regular HTML elements to create interactive experiences. When these rely on vision and mouse interaction (for example, image carousels), they can be inaccessible for many people. The roles and attributes defined by ARIA seeks to provide a mechanism to allow these widgets to interact more effectively with assistive technologies.</p>
<p>They do this in two ways - through the use of roles (which describe the role of the element in the page) and through attributes (which convey information to assistive technologies).</p>
<h4 id="aria-roles">ARIA Roles</h4>
<p>The roles describe the intent of an HTML tag that has no semantic meaning - i.e. a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This can help convey through a screen reader what most users would deduce visually.  For example, if we were displaying a math equation, we could use the <code>math</code> role:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">role</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;math&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  y = 1/2x + 3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Likewise, an image containing an equation could be labeled with the <code>math</code> role:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;line-eq.png&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;The equation for the line y = 1/2x + 3&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">role</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;math&#34;</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>ARIA began as an extension to HTML, but many of its ideas have now been integrated directly into HTML through semantic equivalents.Where possible, use HTML5 equivalents, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>article</code> use <code>&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>figure</code> use <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>img</code> use <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>main</code> use <code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>navigation</code> use <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>region</code> use <code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a complete list of roles and recommendations for using them <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles" target="_blank">in the MDN documentation</a>
.</p>
<h4 id="aria-attributes">ARIA Attributes</h4>
<p>ARIA attributes convey information to assistive technologies. For example, the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute signals to assistive technologies that a particular element can be ignored by the assistive technology. Consider a product logo that appears in multiple locations on the page.</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;logo.png&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;logo&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">aria-hidden</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;true&#34;</span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>aria-hidden</code> here indicates to a screen reader that it does not need to call out to the viewer the existence of the logo.</p>

<!--

There are six categories of ARIA roles:

#### Document Structure Roles 
These identify the _structural_ purpose for a section of content.  I.e. a <div> that only appears when an associated element is hovered over we would call a _tooltip_:

```html
When you hover over this 
<span class="tooltip-wrapper">
  term
  <div class="tooltip" role="tooltip">
    Hello! I'm a tooltip!
  </div>
</span>
, you will get a surprise!
<style>
  .tooltip { 
    display: none; 
  }
  .tooltip-wrapper { 
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .tooltip-wrapper:hover>.tooltip 
  {
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    border: 2px gray;
    padding: 5px;    
    background-color: yellow;
  }
</style>
```

<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 2rem;">
When you hover over this 
<span class="tooltip-wrapper">
  term
  <div class="tooltip" role="tooltip">
    Hello! I'm a tooltip!
  </div>
</span>
, you will get a surprise!
<style>
  .tooltip { 
    display: none; 
  }
  .tooltip-wrapper { 
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .tooltip-wrapper:hover>.tooltip 
  {
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    border: 2px gray;
    padding: 5px;    
    background-color: yellow;
  }
</style>
</div>

ARIA began as an extension to HTML, but many of its ideas have now been integrated directly into HTML through semantic equivalents.Where possible, use HTML5 equivalents, i.e.

* `article` use `<article>`
* `figure` use `<figure>`
* `img` use `<image>` or `<picture>`

You can find a full list of structural roles [in the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#1._document_structure_roles)

#### Widget Roles 
These describe common interactive patterns found in websites.  The most common of these are:

* scrollbar
* searchbox
* separator (when focusable)
* slider
* spinbutton
* switch
* tab
* tabpanel
* treeitem
* combobox
* menu
* menubar
* tablist
* tree
* treegrid

You can find a full list [in the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#2._widget_roles)

#### Landmark Roles

Landmark roles help identify the organization and structure of a web page - i.e. what is the most important part (`main`), complementary information (`complementary`), or search controls (`search`).  Many of these have been replaced by semantic HTML elements.

* `banner` typically use `<header>`
* `complementary` use (`<aside>`)
* `contentinfo` typically use `<footer>`
* `main` use `<main>`
* `navigation` use `<nav>`
* `region` use `<section>`
* `search`

You can read more about these roles [in the MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#3._landmark_roles).

#### Live Region Roles

These indicate content that will be dynamically changed:

* `alert`
* `log`
* `marquee`
* `status`
* `timer`

#### Window Roles

These are sub-windows to the main document window, i.e. dialogs.

* `alertdialog`
* `dialog`

#### Abstract Roles

These are used by browsers to organize and streamline document loading.  You should not use them in your HTML.

<h1 id="understandable-content">Understandable Content</h1>

<p>Understandable content means that the user can easily make sense of it. This clearly includes of reading and understanding the text of the page. You should strive to use proper grammar, correct spelling, and write to your audience&rsquo;s expected reading level (or slightly below).</p>
<p>But this requirement also covers users understanding how to make use of interactive elements, especially graphical user interfaces. Making your content understandable benefits all users of your website, and is a staple to good web design.</p>
<p>Finally, it also means that navigation, especially finding information on your website - should be clear and understandable.  Universities are rightly criticized for having difficult-to navigate web sites. No doubt you&rsquo;ve encountered this yourself.</p>
<p>Consider that a staple how-to design manual for web development is titled &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Make me Think&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Just as you can use W3C&rsquo;s validator to help validate your HTML, tools exist to help evaluate the accessibility of your websites. The easiest of these are integrated into the developer tools of your browser.  The following video covers using Chrome developer tools to address accessibility bugs:</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-nv-SCj4Q">YouTube Video</a>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about Screen Readers and Magnifiers, which are typically integrated into your operating system. You can use these to experience your web page the same way a disabled user might.</p>
<p>Similarly, a colorblindness simulator can alter the colors in your screen to simulate what a colorblind person might see.  A good example is <a href="https://colororacle.org/" target="_blank">Color Oracle</a>

<p>We also learned that many of these techniques benefit <em>all</em> users. Strong color contrast can help both the vision impaired, and also help make your site visible on a screen outside on a bright day.

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>In computer graphics, we have two primary approaches to representing graphical information, <em>raster</em> and <em>vector</em> representations.</p>
<p>Raster graphics take their name from the scan pattern of a cathode-ray tube, such as was used in older television sets and computer monitors.  These, as well as modern monitors, rely on a regular grid of pixels composed of three colors of light (red, green, and blue) that are mixed at different intensities to create all colors of the visible spectrum.</p>
<style>
    figure.bordered {
        border: 1px solid green;
        padding: 2rem;
    }
    figure.
</style>
<figure class="bordered"><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/cathode-ray-tube.png"
         alt="A cathode ray tube cutwaway diagram with numbered parts."/><figcaption>
            <h4>Cathode Ray Tube</h4><p>A cathode ray tube (CRT) screen works by firing electrons out of an electron gun (1) through electromagnetic coils (2) that steer them through a perforated mask (3) that separates the electrons corresponding to the red, green, and blue components of an individual pixels.  These electrons then strike the phosphor-coated back of the screen (4), causing it to emit photons of a particular wavelength.Image courtesy of Søren Peo Pedersen, made available through the creative commons share-alike 3.0 license.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This inheritance from CRT monitors is important, because it affects several details about how computer graphics are implemented.  Because CRT screens blend three colors of light (red, green, and blue) at different intensities, they needed to be supplied these intensities, and they needed to be grouped together into single pixels, as the electron gun can only light up a single cluster of phosphorus dots at once.  The illusion of a continuous image is generated because the electron beam scans across the back of the screen so rapidly that the pixels appear to be constantly lit.</p>
<p>The scanning pattern the electron beam takes begins at the upper left corner of the screen, and sweeps from left to right.  When the right edge of the screen is reached, then the beam drops to the next row, and again scans left to right.  This continues until the lower right corner is reached, at which point the beam begins back in the upper left-hand corner - just like reading a book in the English language.  CRT screens were first used in analog televisions, which receive a continuous signal that streams pixel intensities, so this made a lot of sense to the engineers designing them.  When computers first started needing monitors, the existing CRT technology was adapted to fit them - as a result, in computer graphics, the origin is in the upper left corner of the screen, and the y-axis increases in a downward direction:</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>The origin being located in the upper-left corner and the Y-axis increasing in a downward direction sometimes confuses novice programmers, who expect the origin to be in the lower right corner and the y-axis to increase in an upward direction, as is the case in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry" target="_blank">Euclidean geometry</a>
.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Additionally, early computers needed a location to store what should be displayed on the screen, which the computer’s VGA card could then continuously stream from to correctly display on-screen.  This video memory consisted of a linear array of pixel data - each pixel was typically represented by three eight-bit numbers corresponding to the intensity of the red, green, and blue for each pixel.  Thus, each intensity would range from 0 (fully off) to 255 (fully on; remember, $2^8 = 256$).  This was, in the early days of computers, quite memory-consumptive (a VGA monitor would use 640 x 489 x 3 bytes, or 900 kilobytes to hold the screen’s data), so many early graphics cards supported alternative graphics modes used a color lookup table and kept corresponding indices in the linear array.  While this is no longer common in modern computer equipment, some simple embedded systems still utilize these kinds of video modes.</p>

<h1 id="raster-graphic-files">Raster Graphic Files</h1>

<p>Unsurprisingly, graphic files that store their data in a raster format borrow heavily from the representations discussed <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/7-graphics/01-introduction/">previously</a>
.  Typically, a graphic file consists of two parts, a <em>head</em> and a <em>body</em>.  This is very much like how the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a HTML file provides metadata about the page and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> contains the actual page contents. For a raster graphic file, the head of the file contains metadata describing the image itself - the color format, along with the width and height of the image.  The body contains the actual raster data, in a linear array much like that used by the computer screen.</p>
<p>This data may be compressed, depending on the file format used.  Some compression algorithms, like the one used in JPEG files, are lossy (that is, they “lose” some of the fine detail of the image as a side-effect of the compression algorithm).  Tagged image file format (tiff), bitmaps (bmp), and portable network graphics (png) are popular formats for the web with the latter (png) especially suitable for websites.</p>
<p>The origin of a raster graphic file is also in the upper left corner, and the raster data is typically comprised of three or four eight-bit color channels corresponding to Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (the alpha channel is typically used to represent the opacity of the pixel, with 255 being completely solid and 0 being completely transparent).  Because the raster data for video memory and for raster graphic files are ordered in the same way, putting a raster graphic on-screen simply requires copying the pixel data from one linear array into the other - a relatively fast process (Computer scientists would describe it as having a complexity of $O(n)$).</p>

<h1 id="html-raster-graphics">HTML Raster Graphics</h1>

<p>The most obvious use of raster graphics in HTML is the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, a HTML element that embodies a single raster graphic image.  It is defined with the an img tag:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>src</code> attribute is a relative or absolute url of an image file, and the <code>alt</code> attribute provides a textual description of what the image portrays.  It is what the browser displays if the image file does not load, and is also important for screen readers (as discussed in <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/6-accessibility/">Chapter 6</a>
).</p>
<p>Any HTML element can also be given a raster graphic to use as a background through the CSS <code>background-image</code> property:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">background-image</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">url</span><span style="color:#f92672">([</span><span style="color:#f92672">route</span><span style="color:#f92672">/</span><span style="color:#f92672">to</span><span style="color:#f92672">/</span><span style="color:#f92672">file</span><span style="color:#f92672">]));</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The  <code>url()</code> function converts a relative or absolute path (<code>[route/to/file]</code>) for the browser to retrieve with a HTTP request (relative paths are relative to the file containing the rule declaration).  By default, the image will have its origin in the upper left corner of the HTML element the rule is applied to, and will extend pixel-by-pixel until the edge of the containing element is reached (this means that to display the full image, you may need to set the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes for the element as well).  If the image is smaller than the containing element, it will be tiled.  Tiling can be conditionally turned off through the  <code>background-repeat property</code>, in the X, Y, or both axes.  You can also stretch, crop, and shift the image’s origin with other background properties.</p>
<p>In addition to these two strategies for including graphics in a web site, HTML provides a third option in the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. We&rsquo;ll discuss that next.</p>

<h1 id="the-canvas-element">The Canvas Element</h1>

<p>The <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element represents a raster graphic, much like the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.  But instead of representing an existing image file, the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is a blank slate - a grid of pixels on which you can draw using JavaScript.  Becuase a canvas doesn&rsquo;t determine its size from an image file, you need to <em>always</em> declare it with a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attribute (otherwise, it has a width and height of 0):</p>

<p>To draw into a canvas, we also need a <em>context</em>, a JavaScript object that allows us to draw onto the canvas. We&rsquo;ll specifically be using the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>. To get one, we:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a reference to the <code>canvas</code> object</li>
<li>Call its <code>getContext()</code> method with an argument of <code>'2d'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The JavaScript to do so looks like:</p>

<h1 id="the-pen-metaphor">The Pen Metaphor</h1>

<p>Most 2D graphics libraries adopt a &ldquo;pen&rdquo; metaphor to model how they interact with the graphics they draw.  Think of an imaginary pen that you use to draw on the screen.  When you put the pen down and move it across the screen you draw a line - the <em>stroke</em>.  When you lift the pen, you no longer make a mark. The movements of the pen across the canvas also define a <em>path</em>.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods that move this imaginary pen:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>moveTo(x, y)</code> picks up the imaginary pen and puts it back down at the position specified by <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>).</li>
<li><code>lineTo(x, y)</code> moves the imaginary pen across the canvas, drawing a line from its prior position to the position specified by <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</li>
<li><code>bezierCurveTo(c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, x, y)</code> moves the imaginary pen across the canvas following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve" target="_blank">Bezier curve</a>
 defined by the starting point, control points <code>(c1x, c1y)</code>, <code>(c2x, c2y)</code>, and ending point <code>(x, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)</code> draws an arc (a segment of a circle) centered at <code>(x,y)</code> with radius <code>radius</code> and starting at <code>startAngle</code> and ending at <code>endAngle</code> (both measured in radians with the positive x-axis representing 0 radians). An optional final boolean parameter <code>counterclockwise</code>  draws the arc counterclockwise instead of clockwise when <code>true</code>.</li>
<li><code>arcTo(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)</code> works as the <code>arc()</code> method, but it picks up the pen.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand that the path defined by these methods does get drawn into the canvas until one or both of the context&rsquo;s <code>stroke()</code> or <code>fill()</code> functions is called. These methods apply to the current path of the pen - we can also begin a new path with the <code>beginPath()</code> function, which clears all of the previous path.  We can also make the path return to its starting point with the <code>closePath()</code> function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss stroke and fill next, but for now, here is an example of a canvas using the ideas we just discussed:</p>
<p><canvas id="example" width="500" height="300"></canvas></p>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById('example');
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(100, 100);
  ctx.lineTo(100, 200);
  ctx.bezierCurveTo(100, 300, 300, 300, 300, 200);
  ctx.arc(300, 200, 100, 0, Math.PI, true);
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.stroke();

<h1 id="stroke-and-fill">Stroke and Fill</h1>

<p>The stroke and fill work with the current path of the context, defining how the outline and interior of a shape defined by the path are drawn.</p>
<h2 id="stroke">Stroke</h2>
<p>The <code>stroke()</code> draws all of the path segments where the pen was &ldquo;down&rdquo;.  The appearance of the stroke can be altered with specific properties of the canvas:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strokeStyle</code> allows you to set the color of the stroke, i.e. <code>ctx.strokeStyle = 'orange';</code>.  You can use one of the named colors, i.e. <code>'green'</code>, a hexidecimal value, i.e. <code>#fafafa</code>, one of the color functions <code>rgb(233,23,155)</code>, <code>rgba(23,23,23, 0.4)</code>, or a gradient or pattern (see more detail in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeStyle" target="_blank">MDN web docs</a>
).</li>
<li><code>lineWidth</code> allows you to set the width of the drawn line, in coordinate units (pixels of the canvas), i.e. <code>ctx.lineWidth = 3.0;</code></li>
<li><code>lineCap</code> defines what the end of a line looks like, <code>&quot;Butt&quot;</code> for a squared-off end, <code>&quot;round&quot;</code> for a rounded end, or <code>&quot;square&quot;</code> for a box with width and height equal to the line&rsquo;s thickness, centered on the end.</li>
<li><code>lineDashOffset</code> adds an offset to the first dash in a dashed line.  See the discussion of dashed lines below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lines can also be dashed. The nature of the dash is set wit the <code>setLineDash(segmentArray)</code> function of the context. The <code>segmentArray</code> is an array of distances which indicate the length of alternating lines and gaps forming the dash. For example:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ctx</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">setLineDash</span>([<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>]);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Creates a dash pattern of 5 units of line followed by 4 units of space.  Then the pattern repeats, so another 5 units of line, and so on.</p>

<p>Note how we added a <code>beginPath()</code> to change the line style, and also how that altered the behavior of the <code>closePath()</code> function (instead of closing with the original point of the first path, it closes with the first point of the second path).

<p>The <code>fill()</code> function fills in the shape outlined by the path (both the parts where the pen was &ldquo;down&rdquo; and also &ldquo;up&rdquo;). The appearance of the fill can <em>also</em> be altered with the <code>fillStyle</code> property of the canvas.</p>
<p>The <code>fillStyle</code> property allows you to change the color of the fill with one of several possible values: color i.e. <code>ctx.fillStyle='purple';</code>. It can use named colors (i.e. <code>'green'</code>), hexidecimal values (i.e. <code>#ffffdd</code>), one of the color functions (i.e. <code>rgb(0.4, 0.4. 0.9)</code>), a gradient, which can be linear, conic, or radial, or a pattern, such as repeating images.

<h1 id="shape-functions">Shape Functions</h1>

<p>For ease of use, the context also supplies a number of functions for drawing shapes. Some of these just define the shape as a series of subpaths to be used with the <code>stroke()</code> and <code>fill()</code> functions.</p>
<h2 id="arcs-and-circles">Arcs and Circles</h2>
<p>Of these, we&rsquo;ve already seen the <code>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)</code> function. It can be used to draw an arc, or when filled, a wedge - like a pie slice. When a <code>startAngle</code> of 0 and <code>endAngle</code> of <code>2 * Math.PI</code> is used, it instead draws a complete circle.</p>

<p>There is also an <code>ellipse(x, y, radiusX, radiusY, startAngle, endAngle)</code> function. It works in a similar way, creating an ellipse centered on the point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) with a horizontal radius of <code>radiusX</code> and a vertical radius of <code>radiusY</code>, and starting and ending angles of <code>startAngle</code> and <code>endAngle</code> (specified in radians).  As with the <code>arc()</code> method, a <code>startAngle</code> of 0 and <code>endAngle</code> of <code>2 * Math.PI</code> creates a full ellipse.</p>
<h2 id="rectangle">Rectangle</h2>
<p>The <code>rect(x, y, width, height)</code> function draws a rectangle with upper left corner at <code>(x, y)</code> and dimensions <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. In addition to the <code>rect()</code> function, there are some shorthand functions that <em>also</em> stroke or fill the rect <em>without altering the current path</em>.</p>
<p>The first of these is <code>fillRect(x, y, width, height)</code> which uses the same arguments as <code>rect()</code> and fills the resulting rectangle with the current fill style. We used this in the <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/7-graphics/01-introduction/">introduction</a>
.</p>
<p>The second is the <code>clearRect(x, y, width, height)</code> function, which fills the rect defined by the arguments with <em>transparent black</em> (<code>rgba(0,0,0,0)</code>), effectively erasing everything in that rectangle on the canvas.</p>

<p>Why the extra rectangle shorthands, and not other shapes? Remember, computer graphics have traditionally been <em>rectangular</em>, i.e. windows are rectangles. So programmers have gotten used to using rectangles in a lot of places, so having the extra shorthands made sense to the developers. Also, both <code>fillRect()</code> and <code>clearRect()</code> are used to quickly clear <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements of any prior drawing, especially when creating canvas animations.</p>

<h1 id="canvas-text">Canvas Text</h1>

<p>While the canvas is primarily used to draw graphics, there are times we want to use text as well.  We have two methods to draw text: <code>fillText(text, x, y)</code> and <code>strokeText(text, x, y)</code>. The <code>text</code> parameter is the text to render, and the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the upper left corner of the text.</p>
<p>As with the <code>fillRect()</code> and <code>strokeRect()</code> functions, <code>fillText()</code> and <code>strokeText()</code> fill and stroke the text, respectively, and the text does not affect the current path. The text properties are set by properties on the context:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>font</code> is the font to use for the text. It uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. I.e. <code>ctx.font = 10pt Arial;</code></li>
<li><code>textAlign</code> sets the alignment of the text. Possible values are <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>center</code>.</li>
<li><code>textBaseline</code> sets the baseline alignment for the text. Possible values are <code>top</code>, <code>hanging</code>, <code>middle</code>, <code>alphabetic</code>, <code>ideographic</code>, or <code>bottom</code>.</li>
<li><code>direction</code> the directionality of the text. Possible values are <code>ltr</code> (left-to-right), <code>rtl</code> (right-to-left), and <code>inherit</code> (inherit from the page settings).</li>
</ul>

<p>Because a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element is itself a grid of pixels just like an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, you can <em>also</em> use a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> in a <code>drawImage()</code> call! This can be used to implement <em>double-buffering</em>, a technique where you draw the entire scene into a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element that is not shown in the webpage (known as the back buffer), and then copying the completed scene into the on-screen <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> (the front buffer).</p>

<h1 id="transforms-and-state">Transforms and State</h1>

<p>Much like we can use CSS to apply transformations to HTML elements, we can use transforms to change how we draw into a canvas. The rendering context has a transformation matrix much like those we discussed in the CSS chapter, and it applies this transform to any point it is tasked with drawing.</p>
<p>We can replace the current transformation matrix with the <code>setTransform()</code> function, or multiply it by a new transformation (effectively combining the current transformation with the new one) by calling <code>transform()</code>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it can be useful to know two other functions of the context, <code>save()</code> and <code>restore()</code>.  These save the current context state by pushing and popping from a stack.  Think of it as a pile of papers. When we call <code>save()</code> we write down the current state of the context object, and drop that paper in the stack.  When we call <code>restore()</code>, we take the topmost paper from the stack, and set context&rsquo;s state back to what was written on that sheet.</p>
<p>So what exactly constitutes the state of our rendering context? As you might imagine, this includes the transformation matrix we just talked about.  But it <em>also</em> includes all of the stroke and fill properties.</p>
<p>Now, back to the transforms.  As with CSS transforms, we can define the matrix ourselves, but there also exist a number of helper functions we can leverage, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>translate(tx, ty)</code> translates by <code>tx</code> in the x axis, and <code>ty</code> along the y</li>
<li><code>rotate(angle)</code> rotates around the z-axis by the supplied <code>angle</code> (specified in radians)</li>
<li><code>scale(sx,sy)</code> scales by <code>sx</code> along the x axis, and <code>sy</code> along the y axis. This is expressed as a decimal value: <code>1.0</code> indicates 100%, <code>0.5</code> for 50%, and <code>1.75</code> for 175%</li>
</ul>

  var ty = 180;
  
  ctx.translate(tx, ty);
  ctx.rotate(Math.PI/4);
  ctx.translate(-tx, -ty);

  ctx.strokeText("Hello Canvas", 100, 180);

<h1 id="animation">Animation</h1>

<p>The canvas element provides a powerful tool for creating animations by allowing us to erase and re-draw its contents over and over. Ideally, we only want to redraw the canvas contents only as quickly as the screen is updated (typically every 1/30th or 1/60th of a second).  The <code>window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)</code> provides an approach for doing this - it triggers the supplied callback every time the monitor refreshes.</p>
<p>Inside that callback, we want to erase the canvas and then draw the updated scene. Here is an example animating a ball bouncing around the canvas:</p>
<p><canvas id="example" width="500" height="300"></canvas></p>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById('example');
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  var x = 100;
  var y = 100;
  var dx = Math.random();
  var dy = Math.random();
  
  function animate(timestamp)
  {
    ctx.fillStyle = 'pink';
    ctx.fillRect(0,0,500,300);
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(x, y, 25, 0, 2*Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.stroke();
    x += dx;
    y += dy;
    if(x < 25 || x > 475) dx = -dx;
    if(y < 25 || y > 275) dy = -dy;
    window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }

  animate();

<h1 id="vector-graphics">Vector Graphics</h1>

<p>Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve been discussing raster graphics, which are represented by a grid of pixels.  In contrast, <em>vector</em> graphics are stored as <em>a series of instructions</em> to re-create the graphic. For most vector approaches, these instructions look similar to those we issued to our JavaScript rendering context when working with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element - including the idea of paths, stroke, and fill.</p>
<p>The vector approach has its own benefits and drawbacks when compared to raster graphics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Computation</strong> Before a vector graphic can be displayed, it has to be rendered into a raster form, much like we had to instruct our context to render into a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. This requires some computation, whereas rendering a raster graphic simply requires copying its bits from one buffer to another (assuming we aren&rsquo;t scaling it).</li>
<li><strong>Better Scaling</strong> Perhaps the biggest benefit is that the problems we see when scaling a raster graphic don&rsquo;t happen with vector graphics.  If we want to make the graphic ten times larger, then when we convert it into a raster, we can scale up the drawing instructions to ten times the normal size.</li>
<li><strong>Less Photorealistic</strong> Vector graphics are best suited for images with well-defined shapes with little shading - things like clipart and cartoon characters. To approach photorealism requires a lot of small shapes drawn in different colors, and will require both more memory and computation.  In contrast, a raster graphic is excellent at photorealism. Digital cameras actually create a raster graphic from a grid of color sensors behind the lens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the scaling benefits, vector graphics are used for commonly used for fonts, icons, and logos, and other images that may be presented at vastly different scales.</p>

<h1 id="svg">SVG</h1>

<p>The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image format is a file format for creating a vector graphic. It uses the same ideas about path, stroke, and fill and coordinate that we discussed with the canvas.  It <em>also</em> is a text format based on XML, as was HTML.  So the contents of a XML file will look familiar to you. Here is an example:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M 100 50 L 100 150 L 300 150 Z" stroke="black" fill="#dd3333"/>
</svg>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-svg" data-lang="svg"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;svg</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">viewBox=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;0 0 500 200&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">xmlns=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;path</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">d=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;M 100 50 L 100 150 L 300 150 Z&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">stroke=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;black&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">fill=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;#dd3333&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">/&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/svg&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s take a close look at the file format. First, like HTML and other XML derivatives, we use tags to specify elements.  The <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag indicates the top level of our SVG image, much like the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag does for HTML. The <code>xmlns</code> links to the specification of the XML format, and should be included in all <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements (it&rsquo;s one of the requirements of the XML format - earlier versions of HTML did this as well for the HTML namespace, but HTML5 broke away from the requirement).</p>
<p>Likewise the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element defines a path, much like those we drew with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and its rendering context. The <code>d</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> is its <em>data</em>, and it provides it a series of commands and values, separated by spaces. These instruct the program rendering the SVG in how to move the imaginary pen around.  The <code>stroke</code> and <code>fill</code> attributes specify how the resulting path should be stroked and filled.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>viewBox</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag describes what part of the image should be rendered. This is specified as a rectangle, following the familiar format of <code>x y width height</code>, where the point (<code>x</code>,<code>y</code>) is the upper left corner, and <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> specify a distance to the left and down, respectively.</p>
<p>The <code>viewBox</code> plays an important role in how SVG graphics scale.  If we used this SVG in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and set it to have a different width, it would automatically scale the view box contents to match:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200">
  <path d="M 100 50 L 100 150 L 300 150 Z" stroke="black" fill="#dd3333"/>
</svg>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/images/triangle.svg&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">width</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;200&#34;</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that you understand the basics, let&rsquo;s turn our attention to some specific SVG elements.</p>

<p>There is an important idea in the above discussion - the SVG file format specifies <em>how</em> the image should be drawn. But it is up to the program reading the SVG to actually <em>carry out the drawing commands</em>. As this is much more involved than simply copying raster bits, not all image viewing software support SVG files. However, all modern browsers do.</p>

<h1 id="svg-paths">SVG Paths</h1>

<p>SVGs use the same pen metaphor we saw with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and one of the most basic approaches to drawing in an SVG is the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element. Each <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> should contain a <code>d</code> attribute, which holds the commands used to <em>draw</em> the path. These are very similar to the commands we used with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> we used earlier, but instead of being written as a function call, they are written as a capital letter (indicating what command to carry out) followed by numbers specifying the action.  Let&rsquo;s take another look at our earlier example:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M 100 50 L 100 150 L 300 150 Z" stroke="black" fill="#dd3333"/>
</svg>
<p>The path&rsquo;s data is <code>M 100 50 L 100 150 L 300 150 Z</code>.  Let&rsquo;s break it down one command at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>M 100 50</code> indicates we should move our pen to point (100, 50).</li>
<li><code>L 100 150</code> indicates we should draw a line from our current position to point (100, 150).</li>
<li><code>L 300 150</code> indicates we should draw a line from our current position to point (300, 150).</li>
<li><code>Z</code> indicates we should close our path, drawing a line to where we started (the point specified in our first command).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve worked through a path example, let&rsquo;s discuss the specific commands available to us:</p>
<h2 id="move-to">Move To</h2>
<p>The <code>M x y</code> command indicates we should <em>move to</em> the point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>), picking up our pen. It corresponds to <code>ctx.moveTo(x, y)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="line-to">Line To</h2>
<p>The <code>L x y</code> command indicates we should draw a <em>line</em> from our current position to the point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>). It corresponds to <code>ctx.lineTo(x, y)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-line-to">Horizontal Line To</h2>
<p>The <code>H x</code> command is shorthand for drawing a horizontal line (the y stays the same) from the current x to the provided <code>x</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-line-to">Vertical Line To</h2>
<p>The <code>V y</code> command is shorthand for drawing a vertical line (the x stays the same) from the current y to the provided <code>y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="curve-to">Curve To</h2>
<p>The <code>C cx1 cy1, cx2 cy2, dx, dy</code> is the shorthand for drawing a Bézier Curve from the current position to (<code>dx</code>, <code>dy</code>) using control points (<code>cx1</code>, <code>cy1</code>) and (<code>cx2</code>, <code>cy2</code>). It corresponds to <code>ctx.curveTo(c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, dx, dy)</code>. The MDN web docs has an excellent discussion with visual examples of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths#b%C3%A9zier_curves" target="_blank">Bézier curves</a>
. A visual example of the role of the effect control points have on a Bézier curve from that article appears below:</p>

</a></p>
<h2 id="arc-to">Arc To</h2>
<p>The <code>A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y a rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag dx dy</code> draws an arc. It is roughly analogous to the <code>ctx.drawArc()</code> method, but uses a different way of specifying the arc&rsquo;s start, end, and direction.

<h1 id="svg-shapes">SVG Shapes</h1>

<p>Much like the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2d</code> we used with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> earlier allowed us to render rectangles outside of the path, the SVG format <em>also</em> provides mechanisms for rendering common shapes. These are specified using their own tags (like HTML elements), and there are a wide variety of shapes available:</p>
<h2 id="rectangle">Rectangle</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> element defines a rectangle, specified by the now-familiar <code>x</code>, <code>y,</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes, and with optional rounded corners with radius specified by the <code>rx</code> attribute.</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 220 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="200">
  <!-- Simple rectangle -->
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="cornflowerblue"/>

<p>As with CSS and the canvas, SVGs <em>also</em> support transformations. In an SVG, these are specified by the <code>transform</code> attribute and thus apply to a specific element. For example, to rotate our ellipse from the previous section by 15 degrees around its center, we would use:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="200">
  <ellipse cx="100" cy="50" rx="100" ry="50" fill="cornflowerblue" transform="rotate(15 100 50)"/>

<h2 id="transformation-functions">Transformation Functions</h2>
<p>As with the other transformation approaches we&rsquo;ve seen, SVG transforms are based on matrix math. And, as in those prior approaches, a variety of helpful functions are provided to create the most common kinds of transformation matrices.  The specific transformation functions available in the SVG standard are:</p>
<p><strong>Translate</strong> The <code>translate(tx [ty])</code> translates along the x-axis by <code>tx</code> and the y axis by <code>ty</code>.  If no value for <code>ty</code> is supplied, the value of 0 is assumed.</p>
<p><strong>Scale</strong> The <code>scale(sx [sy])</code> scales the image by <code>sx</code> along the x axis, and by <code>sy</code> along the y axis. If a value for <code>sy</code> is not supplied, then it uses the same value as <code>sx</code> (i.e. the element is scaled along both axes equally).</p>
<p><strong>Rotate</strong> The <code>rotate(angle [x y])</code> rotates the element around the point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) by <code>angle</code> degrees.  If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are omitted, the origin (0,0) is the center of rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Skew</strong> The <code>skewX(angle)</code> skews along the x axis by <code>angle</code> degrees. Likewise, the <code>skewY(angle)</code> skews along the y axis by <code>angle</code> degrees.</p>
<h2 id="grouping-elements">Grouping Elements</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element can be used to group elements together, and apply transformations to the whole group:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="200">
  <g transform="translate(10 -20) rotate(45) skewX(20) scale(0.5)">
    <ellipse cx="100" cy="50" rx="100" ry="50" fill="cornflowerblue" />

<h1 id="svg-and-css">SVG and CSS</h1>

<p>When using inline SVG, you can apply CSS to the SVG using any of the methods we&rsquo;ve used with HTML - inline styles, the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, or a CSS file. The rules work exactly the same - you select a SVG element using a CSS selector, and apply style rules.  SVG elements have tag name, and can also specify <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes just like HTML. For example:</p>
<style>
  rect {
    fill: purple;
    stroke: black;
    stroke-width: 5;
  }
  #my-circle {
    fill: violet;
    stroke: #333;
  }
</style>

<p>As described earlier, SVG is an image file format. Thus, it can be used as the <code>src</code> for an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element in HTML:</p>
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/images/triangle.svg" alt="A triangle">
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/images/triangle.svg&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;A triangle&#34;</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, the SVG itself is just text. And that text shares a lot of characteristics with HTML, as both are derived from XML. As SVG became more commonplace, the W3C added support for <em>inline SVGs</em> - placing SVG code directly in a HTML document:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

<ol>
<li>The SVG is contained in the html document, so there is no need to download additional files as with an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li>The SVG definition <em>also</em> contains a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, which is identical to its HTML counterpart. When you use the SVG inline, it works just like a regular link in the page.</li>
<li>The inline SVG can also be modified by CSS and JS - we&rsquo;ll take a look at each next.</li>

<h1 id="svg-and-javascript">SVG and JavaScript</h1>

<p>Likewise, inline SVG elements are part of the DOM tree, and can be manipulated with JavaScript in <em>almost</em> the same way as any HTML element. You can retrieve a SVG node with the various query methods: <code>document.getElementsByName(name)</code>, <code>document.getElementById(id)</code>, <code>document.getElementsByClassName(className)</code>, <code>document.querySelector()</code>, and <code>document.querySelectorAll(selector)</code>. This works just like it does with HTML elements.</p>
<p>However, to work with the attributes of a SVG element, you must use the <code>setAttributeNS(ns, attr)</code> and <code>getAttributeNS(ns, attr)</code> respectively, as the SVG attributes are part of the SVG namespace, <em>not</em> the HTML (default) namespace.</p>
<p>The example below uses JavaScript to resize the circle based on a HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element:</p>
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle id="my-circle" cx="150" cy="50" r="40" fill="rgb(121, 60, 204)"/>
</svg>
<input id="radius-input" type="number" value="50" max="100" min="0">
<script>
  var input = document.getElementById('radius-input');
  input.addEventListener('change', function(event)
  {
    event.preventDefault();
    var radius = event.target.value;
    var circle = document.getElementById('my-circle');
    circle.setAttributeNS(null, 'r', radius);
  });

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Earlier, when we <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/">looked at HTTP in Chapter 2</a>
, we discussed how HTTP connects the client (typically a web browser) to a <em>server</em>, a specialized program running on a computer connected to the internet that serves web pages (and other files) in response to a HTTP request. This server is what makes your webpages available on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, web developers and IT professionals commonly refer to <em>both</em> the program serving HTTP requests <em>and</em> the hardware it runs on as a <em>server</em>. To help avoid this confusion in this chapter, we&rsquo;ll refer to the computer running the server as the <em>server hardware</em> and the software program serving HTTP requests as the <em>server program</em>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at exactly what a server (both hardware and program) is, and how it is made accessible on the web. Then we&rsquo;ll examine some of the most widely used of the server programs: Apache, Nginx, and IIS. We&rsquo;ll also discuss setting up domain names and security certificates - all the steps necessary for hosting your own websites.</p>

<p>We will look at setting up these servers to serve <em>static</em> content - the kinds of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files you&rsquo;ve been writing in this class. However, it is important to understand that a web server can also <em>dynamically create</em> files to send as a response - as you see every time you use a search engine or an online store. In these cases, the HTML they send is <em>created by the server</em> in response to the requests made by you, the user. This kind of dynamic web content creation is the subject of the follow-on courses, <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc515" target="_blank">CC 515 - Full Stack Web Development</a>

<h1 id="server-hardware">Server Hardware</h1>

<p>The server hardware is really nothing more than a computer - essentially the same as your desktop or laptop. It has a CPU, RAM, hard drives, and a network card, just like your PC - often they are exactly the same hardware as you might find in a PC. But in many cases, they may be designed for sustained repeated and heavy use - basically a more robust (and expensive) version of consumer hardware. They often also are designed to use less power and generate less heat. And they often have far more RAM and hard drives than a consumer PC.</p>
<p>Most server hardware is installed in racks instead of the more familiar PC case. This allows a lot of servers to be installed in a single room (often called a data center) and allows more air to flow around the hardware, keeping it cool. Remember, a computer consumes electricity as it runs and generates heat - if you put a bunch of them together in a data center you are using a <em>lot</em> of electricity and producing a <em>lot</em> of heat. Thus, data centers are designed to supply a lot of electricity, and have extremely powerful air conditioning systems to remove all of that waste heat. Many data centers also have an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) system or even a generator to provide backup power during a power outage.</p>

            <h4>A data center with multiple server racks by Alexis Lê-Quôc from New York, United States</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You may have noticed that data centers like the one pictured above don&rsquo;t have a lot of computer monitors - because if the whole purpose of the computer is to serve responses to HTTP requests, you really don&rsquo;t need to hook it up to a monitor very often. Instead, we typically connect to web server hardware through the network, from a regular laptop or PC.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that you can&rsquo;t run a web server from a normal PC or laptop and make it accessible on the web - you certainly can!  However, to do so, you need one other thing - a static IP address - which we&rsquo;ll discuss next.</p>

<h1 id="static-ip-addresses">Static IP Addresses</h1>

<p>You may remember from our discussion of <a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/02-uris-and-urls/">URIs and URLs in Chapter 2</a>
 that a HTTP request must be made against a <em>host</em>.  This host is specified either by a fully-qualified domain name, or by an Internet Protocol (IP) address. But what exactly is an IP address?</p>
<p>An IP address is an address of a specific computer on the internet. Without such an address, we would not be able to send HTTP requests or responses to a computer, because we would have no idea where to send it. This is much like a mailing addresses in the real world - you need to know where to send a letter for the post office to deliver it.</p>
<p>Now we get to the interesting part - unlike mailing addresses, there are a limited number of IP addresses because we represent them with a specific number of bits (32 bits for IPV4 addresses, and 128 for the new IPV6 addresses).</p>

</a></p>
<p>Because of this limit, internet providers don&rsquo;t assign every customer a unique IP address. Instead, they use a <em>pool</em> of addresses. When your computer connects to the internet, they draw a currently unused IP address from the pool and assign it to your computer. This is your computer&rsquo;s address until you disconnect.  The next time you connect, you may get a different IP address.  It&rsquo;s kind of like parking in a parking garage - you probably won&rsquo;t get the same space every time.</p>
<p>This makes hosting a website from a consumer internet account very difficult, because every time you get a new IP address, you&rsquo;d need to update everyone about where to find your web server. Also, many consumer ISP agreements actually forbid you from hosting a website on your account - so read your agreements carefully.</p>
<p>In contrast, when you sign up with an ISP as a web host (often a feature of business plans), your ISP provides one or more IP address that your computer(s) will <em>always</em> be assigned. We call these <em>static IP addresses</em> because they don&rsquo;t change. This means that even if your computer is disconnected from the internet temporarily, when you reconnect, you will still have the same IP address. These accounts also typically provide more <em>upstream</em> data (the data your computer sends out across the internet), which is important as a web server will send far more data upstream than a consumer browsing the internet will.</p>
<p>Thus, if you plan on hosting your own website, you want a static IP address provided by a hosting plan with your ISP.</p>

<h1 id="domain-names">Domain Names</h1>

<p>A domain name is a human-readable name that can be used instead of an IP address when making HTTP requests. While not actually required for hosting a website, a domain name is definitely something you&rsquo;ll want to have. After all, you don&rsquo;t want people to have to memorize an IP address to reach your website.</p>
<p>Domain names are essentially leased (rented) from a domain registrar - a company that sells domain names. Some better-known registrars are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain.Com</li>
<li>NameCheap</li>
<li>GoDaddy</li>
<li>Google Domains</li>
<li>Dreamhost</li>
<li>HostGator</li>
<li>Network Solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>A domain registrar works with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), as they &ldquo;register&rdquo; the domain with ICANN which oversees the domain name system (DNS). This includes a network of special web servers that respond to a query for a domain name with the corresponding IP address.</p>
<p>Once you own a domain name, you must also create <em>name records</em> within the DNS network to allow your domain name to be looked up by web browsers. These records are typically entered on a DNS server operated by your domain registrar, though some large institutions (like Kansas State University) operate their own DNS server. Name records have a standard syntax (they are basically text files), but typically are entered through a web interface that can look different depending on which registrar you are working with.  You can read more about the specific name records in this <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/" target="_blank">article by Cloudflare</a>
.</p>
<p>Once you have your computer assigned a static ip address, and a domain name registered that points at that address, the next step is to ensure that the correct ports are open on your server hardware&rsquo;s operating system.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>As domain name to IP mappings are cached at multiple points along this network, as well as your ISP and web browser, changes to where a domain name point can take up to a day to percolate through this whole system. This delay often surprises new web developers, who are used to the &ldquo;instant response&rdquo; of most computing systems.</p>

<h1 id="ports">Ports</h1>

<p>The term <em>port</em> is another that has multiple meanings in Computer Science and can lead to some confusion.  It can refer to a physical port on the computer that you plug something into, i.e. a USB port or a CAT5e networking port. But it has another meaning for software running on a network (like the internet).</p>
<p>Your computer probably is running multiple programs that communicate across a network or the internet - i.e. you might be browsing the web with Chrome, checking your email with Outlook, and chatting with friends on Discord. Your computer and the network it is connected to need a way to route the messages intended for each of these separate applications to the right program. The solution that we use is that each program is assigned a unique <em>port number</em>, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer (thus, it can range from 0 to 65535).</p>
<p>A good analogy is to think of your computer as an apartment building.  The apartment building itself has a street address that is common to all the apartments.  This corresponds to the IP address.  Then, each individual apartment has an apartment number.  You need to provide both the street address and apartment number to send a letter to someone (a program) living in a particular apartment.</p>
<p>Each port can only be assigned to one program at a time, and this assignment is handled by the operating system (i.e. Windows or Linux). Certain common programs have a <em>default</em> port that we expect them to be assigned, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP servers use port 80</li>
<li>HTTPS servers use port 443</li>
<li>FTP (file transfer protocol) servers use port 20</li>
<li>DNS servers use port 53</li>
<li>SMTP email servers use port 25</li>
<li>POP3 email servers use port 110</li>
<li>IMAP email servers use
port 143</li>
<li>IRC chat servers use 194</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, when you enter a url in your browser (i.e. <a href="https://ksu.edu" target="_blank">https://ksu.edu</a>
), the browser will assume the address it is connecting to is the IP address mapped to ksu.edu with port 443 (as the secure http protocol was specified).  If you want to run your server on a non-standard port, it must be included in the URL, i.e. <a href="https://ksu.edu:3000" target="_blank">https://ksu.edu:3000</a>
 would connect to the IP address mapped to ksu.edu with port 3000.  This is not recommended for the same reasons we use domain names - port numbers are difficult for many users to understand and remember.</p>
<p>Each port represents an opportunity for the outside world to connect to your computer. With that opportunity comes risk - and the potential for cyber attacks against your computer. To lessen this risk, most operating systems use a firewall - a program that limits which ports are open (allowed to accept incoming messages from the network). By default, nearly all your ports are closed by a firewall, including port 80 and 443. In order to make your web server program accessible, you must open these ports by changing your firewall settings.  The exact details of this process differ depending on what firewall and operating system you are using.</p>

<h1 id="server-programs">Server Programs</h1>

<p>Once you have your static IP address, your domain name, and your firewall configured, you are ready to start responding to HTTP requests. This process is handled by a server program - it accepts incoming HTTP an HTTPS requests by determining and sending a response.  In the simplest form, a web server program simply responds with static files that are saved in a particular location - often a folder named <code>public_html</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>www</code>. Thus, a request for <code>http://mysite.com/mypage.html</code> might serve the file <code>www/mypage.html</code>. This is exactly how many web server programs operate.</p>
<p>When webserver programs are used to serve files from a directory like this, there is an open question of what to do when a directory rather than a file is requested, i.e. <code>https://mysite.com</code> or <code>https://mysite.com/pictures</code>.  Most webserver programs configured to serve files will generate a HTML page listing the contents of the directory.  For example, if your <code>www</code> folder contained <code>mypage.html</code>, <code>mypage.css</code>, and the directory <code>pictures</code>, it might generate a page like this:</p>

The widely-adopted solution is that if the directory contains a file named <code>index.html</code>, that is served instead of a generated index. Further, most web server programs can be configured to serve a 404 instead of generating an index.</p>
<p>Three of the best-known web server programs used today are Apache, Nginx, and IIS. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a>
 is one of the earliest widely-adopted web servers.  It is free and open-source, and because of this, it was used for the bulk of web hosting during the period of rapid growth after the world-wide-web became available to the general public in the 1990s and into the 2000s. As of December 2022, Apache is used by 32% of the websites on the Internet <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank">Nginx</a>
 was developed as a potential successor to Apache.  Also an open-source server, it focuses on being fast and lightweight. As of December 2022, it is used by 34% of the websites on the internet <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. While both Apache and Nginx can be installed on multiple operating systems, but for production web servers they are almost exclusively installed on the Linux Operating System (which is also free and open-source). In contrast, Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.iis.net/" target="_blank">IIS</a>
 runs exclusively on Windows Server, and has a much more limited market share, used by only 5.8% of all websites on the internet<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Setting up these three webservers to serve content is one of the subjects covered in the <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527" target="_blank">CC 510</a>
 and <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/" target="_blank">CIS 527</a>
 courses.</p>
<p>Apache, Nginx, and IIS are only a fraction of the many web server programs that are commercially available. In addition, many web server programs (including Apache, Nginx, and IIS) also allow you to write some form of program scripts to generate web pages in addition to serving files. Or, you can even write your own web server programs in just about any programming language.  This is covered in the <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/" target="_blank">CIS 526</a>
 and <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/" target="_blank">CC 515</a>

<p>Now that you have a more nuanced understanding of what it takes to host a website, we can explore options for making the process easier, and potentially more reliable. It is important to understand that few web developers actually tackle every step of the process. Instead, most turn to some form of managed hosting - allowing a business whose primary role is hosting web servers to do some of the work.</p>
<p>Just how much you want to do yourself, versus have a hosting company do is one of the decisions you must make.  At the extreme end, you can put together your server hardware, install and configure your server software, and manage it all out of your own business or home. At the other extreme, there are companies that will provide you with a location you can upload your website files to (via secure ftp or other means), and your code will then be hosted via Apache or Nginx at a domain name you specify.</p>
