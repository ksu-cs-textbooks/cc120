<p>This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.</p>
<p>When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you&rsquo;ll primarily interact with the course. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.</p>
<p>When you first arrive at the Modules section, you&rsquo;ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren&rsquo;t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I&rsquo;ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.</p>
<p>As you look at each module, you&rsquo;ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says &ldquo;Complete All Items.&rdquo; Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.</p>
<p>Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you&rsquo;ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say <em>view</em>, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say <em>contribute</em>, <em>submit</em>, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You&rsquo;ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.</p>
<p>When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I&rsquo;ll click through a couple of items here.</p>
<p>At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you&rsquo;ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>Continuing down the menu to the left, you&rsquo;ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.</p>
<p>Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the <em>Guide</em> for that module. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface.</p>

<p>As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance. This video reviews the various types of help available to you in this course.</p>
<p>First and foremost, anytime you have a questions or need assistance in the Computational Core program, please send an email to the appropriate help group for this course. In this case, it would be cc120-help, or <a href="mailto:cc120-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com">cc120-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>
. That email goes to the instructors and GTAs, and is your best chance to get a quick response. We&rsquo;ll respond to your email within one business day.</p>
<p>Beyond email, there are a few resources you should be aware of. First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, your first source of help is the K-State IT Helpdesk. They can easily be reached via email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ksu.edu">helpdesk@ksu.edu</a>
. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video. As a last resort, you may also want to email the help group, but in most cases we may simply redirect you to the K-State helpdesk for assistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have any issues using the Codio platform, you are welcome to refer to their online documentation. Their support staff offers a quick and easy chat interface where you can ask questions and get feedback within a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there.</p>
<p>If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to post your question as an email to the help group. As discussed earlier, the instructors and GTAs will do their best to help you as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t start building that skill now.</p>
<p>Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. Since this is an online course, you&rsquo;ll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please email me directly as soon as possible and let me know about your concern, if it is appropriate for me to be involved. If not, or if you&rsquo;d rather talk with someone other than me about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your academic advisor, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/report/" target="_blank">https://www.k-state.edu/report/</a>
. That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.</p>
<p>Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, email the help group. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.</p>
<p>So, in summary, reviewing the existing course content should always be your first stop when you have a question or run into a problem, since most issues can be solved there. If you are still stuck, email cc410-help to ask for assistance, and we&rsquo;ll get back to you within a business day. For issues with Canvas or Codio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please email cc410-help or the instructors directly for assistance.</p>
<p>Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don&rsquo;t be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p>
<p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li>
<li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p>
<p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p>
<p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.</p>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong>&ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo;</strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don&rsquo;t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a web developer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong> Many modules will include quizzes which cover the theory, concepts, and vocabulary used in web development. This is all information you should be familiar with as a future web developer.  Most quizzes will allow multiple retakes.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials &amp; Examples:</strong> Each module will include many tutorial assignments and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in project assignments, so it is important that you take the time to learn from these.</p>
<p><strong>Project Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building a number of web pages, including a personal website. Note that all web pages you build for this course should be <em>valid</em> - your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <em>must</em> conform to the standards. Additionally, you will be expected to address accessibility and security in your projects once we&rsquo;ve covered these topics.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% - Quizzes</li>
<li>30% - Tutorials &amp; Exercises</li>
<li>40% - Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the <strong>Extra Credit - Bug Bounty</strong> &amp; <strong>Extra Credit - Helping Hands</strong> assignments for details.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-regrading-and-early-grading-policy">Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy</h3>
<p>As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.</p>
<p>Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones.</p>
<p>For the website milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.</p>
<p>Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.</p>
<p>That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor&rsquo;s receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment&rsquo;s due date has now passed.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment&rsquo;s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</strong> For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank">K-State Grading Policy</a>
 for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>
, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
