<li>Think critically about web page design and apply solid web page design principles to their work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.</p>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong>&ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo;</strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don&rsquo;t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a web developer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong> Many modules will include quizzes which cover the theory, concepts, and vocabulary used in web development. This is all information you should be familiar with as a future web developer.  Most quizzes will allow multiple retakes.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials &amp; Examples:</strong> Each module will include many tutorial assignments and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in project assignments, so it is important that you take the time to learn from these.</p>
<p><strong>Project Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building a number of web pages, including a personal website. Note that all web pages you build for this course should be <em>valid</em> - your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <em>must</em> conform to the standards. Additionally, you will be expected to address accessibility and security in your projects once we&rsquo;ve covered these topics.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% - Quizzes</li>
<li>30% - Tutorials &amp; Exercises</li>
<li>40% - Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the <strong>Extra Credit - Bug Bounty</strong> &amp; <strong>Extra Credit - Helping Hands</strong> assignments for details.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-regrading-and-early-grading-policy">Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy</h3>
<p>As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.</p>
<p>Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones.</p>
<p>For the website milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.</p>
<p>Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.</p>
<p>That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor&rsquo;s receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment&rsquo;s due date has now passed.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment&rsquo;s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</strong> For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank">K-State Grading Policy</a>
 for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>
, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
