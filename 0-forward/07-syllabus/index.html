<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.</p>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong>&ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo;</strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don&rsquo;t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a web developer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials, Quizzes &amp; Examples:</strong> Each module will include many tutorial assignments, quizzes, and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in the milestone assignment of the module - so this practice helps prepare you for those assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Milestone Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building a personal website iteratively; every week a new milestone (a collection of features embodying a new version of a software application) will be due. Each milestone builds upon the prior milestone’s code base, so it is critical that you complete each milestone in a timely manner! This process also reflects the way software development is done in the real world - breaking large projects into more readily achievable milestones helps manage the development process.</p>
<p>Following along that real-world theme, programming assignments in this class will also be graded according to their conformance to coding style, documentation, and testing requirements. Each milestone’s rubric will include points assigned to each of these factors. It is not enough to simply write code that compiles and meets the specification; good code is readable, maintainable, efficient, and secure. The principles and practices of web design that we will be learning in this course have been developed specifically to help address these concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Concept Quizzes:</strong> There will be a couple of concept quizzes throughout the semester to check your understanding of various programming topics. These will allow you to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and your ability to apply what you&rsquo;ve learned to novel situations.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>20% - Tutorials &amp; Quizzes</li>
<li>20% - Examples</li>
<li>20% - Concept Quizzes</li>
<li>40% - Website Milestones</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the <strong>Extra Credit - Bug Bounty</strong> &amp; <strong>Extra Credit - Helping Hands</strong> assignments for details.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-regrading-and-early-grading-policy">Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy</h3>
<p>As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.</p>
<p>Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones.</p>
<p>For the website milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.</p>
<p>Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.</p>
<p>That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor&rsquo;s receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment&rsquo;s due date has now passed.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<div class="notices warning" ><p>Warning</p><p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>

<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment&rsquo;s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</strong> For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" target="_blank">K-State Grading Policy</a> for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" target="_blank">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<p>Students may choose to do some development work on their own computer. The recommended software is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> along with access to a system running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>.

<h3 id="subject-to-change">Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students. All changes may also be posted to Piazza.</p>
<h2 id="standard-syllabus-statements">Standard Syllabus Statements</h2>
<div class="notices info">
    <p>Info</p>
    <p>The statements below are standard syllabus statements from K-State and our program.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one&rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/" target="_blank">Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p>
<p>The Codio platform can perform automatic plagiarism detection by comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p>
<h3 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.

<h3 id="netiquette">Netiquette</h3>
<div class="notices info">
    <p>Info</p>
    <p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href="https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/">this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p>
</div>
<p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p>
<p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li>
<li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li>
<li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li>
<li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li>
<li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li>
<li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&hellip;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li>
<li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/" target="_blank">K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p>
<h3 id="face-coverings">Face Coverings</h3>
<p>All students are expected to comply with K-State’s face mask policy. As of August 2, 2021, everyone must wear face masks over their mouths and noses in all indoor spaces on university property, including while attending in-person classes. This policy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. For additional information and the latest on K-State’s face covering policy, see <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/covid-19/guidance/health/face-covering.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="academic-freedom-statement">Academic Freedom Statement</h3>
<p>Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p>
<h3 id="campus-safety">Campus Safety</h3>
<p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives.

<p>K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college, student life, health and safety, and others found at <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/onestop" target="_blank">www.k-state.edu/onestop</a>.</p>
<h3 id="student-academic-creations">Student Academic Creations</h3>
<p>Student academic creations are subject to Kansas State University and Kansas Board of Regents Intellectual Property Policies. For courses in which students will be creating intellectual property, the K-State policy can be found at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhxr.html" target="_blank">University Handbook, Appendix R: Intellectual Property Policy and Institutional Procedures (part I.E.)</a>. These policies address ownership and use of student academic creations.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>
<p>Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress, discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or emotional abuse.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with these issues, do not wait to seek assistance.</p>
