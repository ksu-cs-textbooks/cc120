      <description>While working for CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), Tim Burners-Lee proposed bringing the ideas of hyper-text documents together with emerging Internet technologies like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Domain Name System (DNS) to create the World-Wide Web. He defined the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the first web server, and the first web browser, in 1990 demonstrating the feasibility of the idea. Since that time, the web has grown to contain around 1.</description>

      <description>At the heart of the world wide web is the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This is a protocol defining how HTTP servers (which host web pages) interact with HTTP clients (which display web pages).
It starts with a request initiated from the web browser or other client. This request is sent over the Internet using the TCP protocol to a web server. Once the web server receives the request, it must decide the appropriate response - ideally sending the requested resource back to the browser to be displayed.</description>

      <description>Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) alongside Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) formed the core of Sir Tim Berners-Lee&amp;rsquo;s world-wide web. As the name implies, HTTP is a markup language, one that combines the text of what is being said with instructions on how to display it.
The other aspect of HTML is its hyper-text nature. Hyper-text refers to text that links to additional resources - primarily the links in the document, but also embedded multimedia.</description>

      <description>Style sheets are collections of rules for modifying how a SGML document appears. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the specific implementation adopted by the W3C for HTML.
The core concept of CSS is that defines rules altering the appearance of HTML elements that can be selectively applied. These rules are held in a document (the style sheet) and are applied in a well-defined priority order (the cascading part of CSS).</description>

      <description>As the World Wide Web was gaining popularity in the mid-nineties, browser manufacturers started experimenting with interpreting program scripts embedded within webpages. By far the most successful of these was JavaScript, initially developed by Brandon Eich for Netscape.
Brandon Eich was hired to integrate the Scheme programming language into the Netscape browser. But when Netscape cut a deal with Sun Microsystems to bring Java Applets to their browser, his mission was altered to create a more Java-like language.</description>

      <description>An important consideration when designing a website is how people will work with it. We want to design our websites in a way that they are useable by everyone in our anticipated audience - bet that everyone in the world, university students, employees at our company, or customers of our business. But there is a segment of each of these audiences that is often overlooked - those with disabilities.
The power of the Web is in its universality.</description>

      <description>The W3C has crafted a number of accessibility standards, as introduced in the following video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards created by the Web Accessibility Initiative:
The specific W3C standards covering web accessibility are:
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) The WACG is built around four principles for content delivered through the web. It should be 1:

      <title>Basic Syntax</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/02-basic-syntax/</guid>
      <description>CONSOLE Because Netscape was adopting Java at the same time they were developing what would become JavaScript, there was a push to make the syntax stay somewhat consistent between the two languages. As a result, JavaScript has much of the look and feel of an imperative language like C, C#, or Java.
However, this similarity can be deceptive, because how JavaScript operates can be quite different than those languages. This can lead to frustration for imperative programmers learning JavaScript.</description>

      <description>CSS properties consist of key-value pairs separated by a colon (:). For example:
color: red
indicates that the styled HTML elements should be given a red color.
Multiple properties are separated by semicolons (;), i.e.:
color: red; background-color: green; Rules are CSS properties grouped within curly braces ({}) and proceeded by a CSS selector to identify the HTML element(s) they should be applied to:
p { color: red; background-color: green; } In this example, all paragraph elements (&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;) should have red text on a green background (how festive!</description>

      <description>HTML was built from the SGML (Structured Generalized Markup Language) standard, which provides the concept of &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo; to provide markup and structure within a text document. Each element in HTML is defined by a unique opening and closing tag, which in turn are surrounded by angle brackets (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;).
For example, a top-level heading in HTML would be written:
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
And render:
Hello World The &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; is the opening tag and the &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; is the closing tag.</description>

      <description>When Tim-Berners Lee presented his original ideas for the World-Wide Web, it consisted of a protocol for requesting web documents - HTTP, and a markup language those documents could be written in - HTML. These initial technologies continue to be the foundation of the world-wide web, and have been enhanced by additional languages to style webpages - CSS - and modify them - JavaScript.
Each of these technologies has continued to evolve under the guidance of the W3C.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/2-http/02-uris-and-urls/</guid>
      <description>Before a web request can be made, the browser needs to know where the resource requested can be found. This is the role that a Universal Resource Locator (a URL) plays. A URL is a specific kind of Universal Resource Indicator (URI) that specifies how a specific resource can be retrieved.
Info
URLs and URIs The terms URL and URI are often used interchangeably in practice. However, a URL is a specific subset of URIs that indicate how to retrieve a resource over a network; while a URI identifies a unique resource, it does not necessarily indicate how to retrieve it.</description>

      <description>In the example from the previous section, we saw:
p { color: red; background-color: green; } Here the p is a CSS Selector, which tells us what elements on the page the CSS rules should be applied to.
Simple Selectors The most basic CSS selectors come in several flavors, which we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at next. Simple selectors are a string composed of alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and underscores (_). Certain selectors also use additional special characters.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/3-html/03-document-structure/</guid>
      <description>When authoring an HTML page, HTML elements should be organized into an HTML Document. This format is defined in the HTML standard. HTML that does not follow this format are technically invalid, and may not be interpreted and rendered correctly by all browsers. Accordingly, it is important to follow the standard.
The basic structure of a valid HTML5 document is:
&amp;lt;!doctype HTML&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Page Title Goes Here&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Page body and tags go here.</description>

      <description>CONSOLE While JavaScript may look like an imperative language on the surface, much of how it behaves is based on functional languages like Scheme. This leads to some of the common sources of confusion for programmers new to the language. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore just what its functional roots mean.
JavaScript implements first-class functions, which means they can be assigned to a variable, passed as function arguments, returned from other functions, and even nested inside other functions.</description>

      <description>What makes web content perceivable? Broadly speaking, the user must be able to see the content through one of their senses. We primarily think about this in terms of sight - the user should be able to see the content of the rendered page. But what we hear can also be a critical piece of perception.
Vision We often think of vision as the primary sense for engaging with web content - after all we read text and view pictures and videos.</description>

      <description>The Web Standards the W3C and ECMA International maintain are a critical piece of the web infrastructure. Having a standard for how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be interpreted by a web browser means that every browser can display the same webpage in the same way - allowing you the choice of your favorite browser without worrying your web browsing experience would be impacted.
This was not always the case; during the early days of the world-wide-web in a period known as the Browser Wars the browsers Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer both added features to their browsers not defined in the standards, and web developers had to decide which browser to build against.</description>

      <description>There are multiple ways CSS rules can be applied to HTML elements. A document containing CSS rules can be attached to a HTML document with a &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; element, embedded directly into the html page with a &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; element, or applied directly to a HTML element with the style attribute. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each option.
Linked CSS Documents The &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; HTML element can be used to link the HTML page it appears in to a text file of CSS rules.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/5-js/04-arrays-and-lists/</guid>
      <description>CONSOLE You might have noticed we used an array in discussing the for .. in loop, but didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about it in our data type discussion. This is because in JavaScript, an array is not a primitive data type. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a special kind of object.
This is one of those aspects of JavaScript that breaks strongly with imperative languages. Brandon Eich drew heavily from Scheme, which is a functional language that focuses heavily on list processing&amp;hellip; and the JavaScript array actually has more to do with lists than it does arrays.</description>

      <description>Now that you are familiar with the network panel, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the primary kind of request you&amp;rsquo;re already used to making - requests originating from a browser. Every time you use a browser to browse the Internet, you are creating a series of HTTP (or HTTPS) requests that travel across the networks between you and a web server, which responds to your requests.
When you type in an address in your browser (or click a hyperlink), this initiates a HTTP request against the server located at that address.</description>

      <description>Given that the role of HTML is markup, i.e. providing structure and formatting to text, HTML elements can broadly be categorized into two categories depending on how they affect the flow of text - inline and block.
Inline elements referred to elements that maintained the flow of text, i.e. the bring attention to (&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;) element used in a paragraph of text, would bold the text without breaking the flow:
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The quick brown &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;fox&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; lept over the log&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>In short, the user should be able to interact effectively with your website. There are two primary tools we use to interact with websites - the mouse and the keyboard. Additionally, many assistive technologies mimic one or both of these.
Keyboard-Only Control While most of us use a mouse as our primary control tool for working with any software, many users cannot use a mouse effectively. For these users, it is important that the entire web page can be controlled using the keyboard.</description>

      <description>Now that we know how to create an apply CSS rules to our HTML, let&amp;rsquo;s explore how they actually are used. A core idea behind CSS is the cascade algorithm, the cascading in cascading style sheets (CSS). The core idea behind the cascade algorithm is that as the browser encounters and parses CSS rules, they are collectively applied to the elements they match with. If the same rule is set multiple times, say color, the cascading algorithm decides which should be applied.</description>

      <description>CONSOLE JavaScript is also an object-oriented language, but the way it implements objects is derived from the ideas of the Self programming language, rather than the C++ origins of Java and C#&amp;rsquo;s object-oriented approaches.
Object Properties Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what an object is in JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a collection of properties - key/value pairs, similar to the concept of a Dictionary in other languages. The properties play both the role of fields and methods of the object, as a property can be assigned a primitive value or a function.</description>

      <description>A HTTP response includes a status code - a numeric code and a human-readable description. The codes themselves are 3-digit numbers, with the first number indicating a general category the response status falls into. Essentially, the status code indicates that the request is being fulfilled, or the reason it cannot be.
1XX Status Codes Codes falling in the 100&amp;rsquo;s provide some kind of information, often in response to a HEAD or upgrade request.</description>

      <description>Tables were amongst the first addition to HTML (along with images), as they were necessary for the primary role of early HTML, disseminating research.
A table requires a lot of elements to be nested in a specific manner. It is best expressed through an example:
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt; &amp;lt;thead&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Name&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt; &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Role&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Darth Vader&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Antagonist&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Luke Skywalker&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Coming-of-age protagonist&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Princess Lea&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Heroic resistance fighter&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Wise old man&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Han Solo&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Likeable scoundrel&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Chewbacca&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;The muscle&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Threepio&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Comedic foil&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Artoo Deetoo&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Plot driver&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/table&amp;gt; It renders as:</description>

      <description>Understandable content means that the user can easily make sense of it. This clearly includes of reading and understanding the text of the page. You should strive to use proper grammar, correct spelling, and write to your audience&amp;rsquo;s expected reading level (or slightly below).
But this requirement also covers users understanding how to make use of interactive elements, especially graphical user interfaces. Making your content understandable benefits all users of your website, and is a staple to good web design.</description>

      <description>Much like there are multiple ways to apply CSS to a web app, there are multiple ways to bring JavaScript into one. We can use a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag with a specified src attribute to load a separate document, put our code into the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag directly, or even add code to attributes of an HTML element. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each option.
Script Tag with Source We can add a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag with a src attribute that gives a url pointing to a JavaScript file.</description>

      <description>But what about two rules that conflict that appear in the same level of the cascade order? For example, given the CSS:
p { color: black; } .warning { color: red; } what would the color of &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;warning&amp;quot;&amp;gt; be? You might say it would be red because the .warning CSS rules come after the p rules. And that would be true if the two rules had the same specificity. An example of that is:</description>

      <description>Forms were also amongst the first additions to the HTML standard, and provide the ability to submit data to a web server. A web form is composed of &amp;lt;input&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;select&amp;gt; and similar elements nested within a &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; element.
The Form Element The form element primarily is used to organize input elements and specify how they should be submitted. In its simplest form, it is simply a tag that other elements are nested within:</description>

      <description>When a web client like a browser makes a request, it must specify the request method, indicating what kind of request this is (sometimes we refer to the method as a HTTP Verb).
The two most common are GET and POST requests, as these are typically the only kinds supported by browsers. Other request methods include PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, which are typically used by other kinds of web clients. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on just GET and POST requests here.</description>

      <description>This page details some of the most commonly used HTML elements. For a full reference, see MDN&amp;rsquo;s HTML Element Reference.
Document-Level Elements These elements describe the basic structure of the HTML document.
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; The &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; element contains the entire HTML document. It should have exactly two children, the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; elements, appearing in that order.
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; The &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; element contains any metadata describing the document. The most common children elements are &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc120/4-css/07-css-units/</guid>
      <description>When specifying CSS rules, you often need to provide a unit of measurement. Any time you provide a measurement in a CSS rule, you must provide the units that measurement is being expressed in, following the value. For example:
#banner { width: 300px; } sets the width of the element with id banner to 300 pixels.
There are actually a lot of units available in CSS, and we&amp;rsquo;ll summarize the most common in this section.</description>

      <description>Just as you can use W3C&amp;rsquo;s validator to help validate your HTML, tools exist to help evaluate the accessibility of your websites. The easiest of these are integrated into the developer tools of your browser. The following video covers using Chrome developer tools to address accessibility bugs:
We&amp;rsquo;ve also talked about Screen Readers and Magnifiers, which are typically integrated into your operating system. You can use these to experience your web page the same way a disabled user might.</description>

      <description>Request headers take the form of key-value pairs, and represent specific aspects of the request. For example:
Accept-Encoding: gzip Indicates that the browser knows how to accepted content compressed in the Gzip format.
Note that request headers are a subset of message headers that apply specifically to requests. There are also message headers that apply only to HTTP responses, and some that apply to both.
As HTTP is intended as an extensible protocol, there are a lot of potential headers.</description>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed the basic syntax and structure of the JavaScript language, and how to load it into a page, we can turn our attention to what it was created for - to interact with web pages in the browser. This leads us to the Document Object Model (DOM).
The DOM is a tree-like structure that is created by the browser when it parses the HTML page. Then, as CSS rules are interpreted and applied, they are attached to the individual nodes of the tree.</description>

      <description>CSS provides a number of useful functions that calculate values. Functions are written in the form name(arg1, arg2, ...) and are provided as values to CSS properties. For example, this CSS code sets the height of the content area to the available space on screen for content after subtracting a header and footer:
#header {height: 150px} #footer {height: 100px} #content { height: calc(100vh - 150px - 100px); } Here 100vh is the height of the viewport, and the header and footer are defined in terms of pixels.</description>

      <description>The Document Object Model (or DOM) is a data structure representing the content of a web page, created by the browser as it parses the website. The browser then makes this data structure accessible to scripts running on the page. The DOM is essentially a tree composed of objects representing the HTML elements and text on the page.
Consider this HTML:
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Hello DOM!&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;link href=&amp;#34;site.css&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;banner&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello DOM!</description>

      <description>JavaScript has been around a long time, and a lot of JavaScript code has been written by inexperienced programmers. Browser manufacturers compensated for this by allowing lenient interpretation of JavaScript programs, and by ignoring many errors as they occurred.
While this made poorly-written scripts run, arguably they didn&amp;rsquo;t run well. In ECMA5, strict mode was introduced to solve the problems of lenient interpretation.
Strict mode according to the Mozilla Developer Network:</description>

We also discussed many common disabilities that users may have, and strategies for addressing these in your web design. We also reviewed tools that we can take advantage of to build accessible websites.
We also learned that many of these techniques benefit all users. Strong color contrast can help both the vision impaired, and also help make your site visible on a screen outside on a bright day.</description>

      <description>CSS also has many properties that can be set to a color, i.e. color, background-color, border-color, box-shadow, etc. Colors consist of three or four values corresponding to the amount of red, green, and blue light blended to create the color. The optional fourth value is the alpha, and is typically used to specify transparency.
Colors are stored as 24-bit values, with 8 bits for each of the four channels (R,G,B,and A), representing 256 possible values (2^8) for each channel.</description>

      <description>CONSOLE The JavaScript String prototype has some very powerful methods, such as String.prototype.includes() which recognizes when a string contains a substring - i.e.:
&amp;#34;foobarwhen&amp;#34;.includes(&amp;#34;bar&amp;#34;) would evaluate to true. But what if you needed a more general solution? Say, to see if the text matched a phone number pattern like XXX-XXX-XXXX? That&amp;rsquo;s where Regular Expressions come in.
Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that define a pattern that can be searched for within a string.</description>

      <description>As the original purpose of the World-Wide-Web was to disseminate written information, it should be no surprise that CSS would provide many properties for working with text. Some of the most commonly employed properties are:
font-family defines the font to use for the text. Its value is one or more font family or generic font names, i.e. font-family: Tahoma, serif, font-family: cursive or font-family: &amp;quot;Comic Sans&amp;quot;. Font family names are typically capitalized and, if they contain spaces or special characters, double-quoted.</description>

      <description>CONSOLE JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation, a serialization format that was developed in conjunction with ECMAScript 3. It is a standard format, as set by ECMA-404.
JSON Format Essentially, it is a format for transmitting JavaScript objects. Consider the JavaScript object literal notation:
var whilma = { name: &amp;#34;Wilma Flintstone&amp;#34;, relationship: &amp;#34;wife&amp;#34; } var pebbles = { name: &amp;#34;Pebbles Flintstone&amp;#34;, age: 3, relationship: &amp;#34;daughter&amp;#34; } var fred = { name: &amp;#34;Fred Flintstone&amp;#34;, job: &amp;#34;Quarry Worker&amp;#34;, payRate: 8, dependents: [whilma, pebbles] } If we were to express the same object in JSON:</description>

      <description>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a term coined by Jesse James Garrett to describe a technique of using the XMLHttpRequest object to request resources directly from JavaScript. As the name implies, this was originally used to request XML content, but the technique can be used with any kind of data.
The XMLHttpRequest The XMLHttpRequest object is modeled after how the window object makes web requests. You can think of it as a state machine that can be in one of several possible states, defined by both a constant and an unsigned short value:</description>

      <description>As the browser lays out HTML elements in a page, it uses the CSS Box Model to determine the size and space between elements. The CSS box is composed of four nested areas (or outer edges): the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.
Box Areas Content Area contains the actual content of the element (the text, image, etc). By default the CSS properties width and height set this size, and the min-width, min-height, max-width, max-height constrain it (but see the discussion of box-sizing below).</description>

      <description>By default HTML elements are positioned in the page using the HTML flow algorithm. You can find a detailed discussion in the MDN Documentation. However, you may want to override this and manually position elements, which you can do with the CSS properties position, left, top, right, and bottom.
The Positioning Context First, we need to understand the positioning context, this is basically the area an element is positioned within. The left, top, right, and bottom properties affect where an element appears within its context.</description>

      <description>We often speak of the separation of concerns principle in the context of web development as setting up the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this understanding, HTML provides the organization of content, CSS provides for the presentation of the content, and JavaScript provides for user interaction.
In this understanding, CSS is often tasked with the role of laying out elements on the page. More specifically, it overrides the default flow of HTML elements (see our earlier discussion of block vs.</description>

      <description>Modern websites are displayed on a wide variety of devices, with screen sizes from 640x480 pixels (VGA resolution) to 3840x2160 pixels (4K resolution). It should be obvious therefore that one-size-fits-all approach to laying out web applications does not work well. Instead, the current best practice is a technique known as Responsive Web Design. When using this strategy your web app should automatically adjusts the layout of the page based on how large the device screen it is rendered on.</description>
